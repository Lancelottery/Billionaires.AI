{"question":"FOLLOWUP: Being retired while my future spouse works toward RE This is a followup to this post :\n\n[https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/cdhsr5\/being\\_retired\\_while\\_my\\_future\\_spouse\\_works\\_toward\/](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/cdhsr5\/being_retired_while_my_future_spouse_works_toward\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI intentionally made a throwaway as I did not want to give too many details about myself or my fiance but based on the responses to the post and how it blew up I thought this sub might benefit from getting some perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for all the response some were very helpful &amp; positive, some were unfortunately unsurprisingly misogynistic, but the reason I am writing this follow up is to give some perspective to the people that were so quick to judge based on the sole fact of someone being 35 having a 1.5MM net worth vs 0 net worth. Many people couldn't even understand how someone could be 35 and have no net worth. This story will have 2 parts mine, the diligent saver, and my fiancee's the apparently financially irresponsible, party girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a first generation Canadian born to working middle class immigrant parents who provided me with a life with basically no wants.While at university I was lucky enough to have a friend to introduce me to FI as a concept and that is when I began planning to RE. When I graduated I had about 40k in loans, I lived with my parents for 2 years while I paid off my loans until I moved out.  During this time, my father became ill and was in and out of hospitals for  about a year. Thankfully since we had universal healthcare the only turmoil we as a family suffered was emotional.  Shortly after my father's recovery I moved abroad, worked in a country with minimal income tax (below 10%),  was paid a salary in USD (yay for the USD to CAD exchange rate), had my housing covered by my employer, and I quickly accumulated the bulk of my net worth. This resulted in having a 1.5MM NW at age 35.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiancee is a first generation American born to a poorer pair of immigrant parents. She too went to university and accumulated some student loans (about 25k) but fewer than me thanks to her scholarships. She was working towards her CPA when her father became ill. Her father had a neurological event that caused him to require a permanent caregiver, his mental faculties were severely compromised and he could basically no longer function on his own. He required multiple operations, months of rehab and a part time caregiver for when his wife, or one of his 2 daughters could not be at home. Since my fiancee is American her family was saddled with 6 figure medical debt. In addition to this my fiancee stalled her career as well. While nobody would think to fire someone due to their family going through a terrible time, my fiancee did have to work closer to a 9-5 (in order to be there for her father) at an accounting firm. This would severely limit any opportunities at promotions as any accountants can vouch during the busy season you basically live at the office in your early career and nobody wants a higher up who isn't willing to commit to the company. A few years ago her father passed and the final financial death knell to my fiancee's net worth was dealt with funeral costs. This is on top of all the years of hardship and emotional turmoil she has gone through. Now that my fiancee has had time to come to terms with the loss of her father she has been able to make great strides in her career, able to move up in a different firm and has significantly increased her salary as well. She was able to slowly pay off her family's debts and become debt free with a net worth of 0, this was also while helping take care of her mother and younger sister.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy am I telling you all of this? In the comments of my original post I was lauded as a financially responsible FIRE focused individual when my only real obstacles were student loans and the emotional struggle of my father's illness. I started FI at 3rd base and was congratulated for running to home and reaching RE. My fiancee was labeled irresponsible, a party girl, and worse. In reality, she had to climb through the minors and reach the majors to just have a chance at bat for FIRE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was and am incredibly lucky, had my country not had universal healthcare, had I not met my friend to introduce me to FIRE so early in life, had I been limited in where I could go to further my career I would not have reached FIRE so quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis sub is one of the most privileged I have ever seen and I do not say this in a bad way. I suspect many of the people who could not understand how an individual can have a low net worth at 35, have most likely led a relatively privileged life as I have. I recommend before we judge anyone based solely for having a low net worth, we may want to realize that not everyone is lucky enough to have a high paying career, low expenses or even basic physical health. Hopefully this post provides some perspective for those who think they can infer all they need to know about a person based only on their financial situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis will most likely be my final post on this account so I wish all of you the best on your own FIRE journeys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. u\/[**Oax\\_Mike**](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/user\/Oax_Mike) I'm not sure if it was your positive attitude, your willingness to tell a truth that I may not have wanted to hear or just your ludicrous ideas at a side gig but just know that your outlook and advice was much appreciated. That is in addition to my gratitude to everyone who offered their advice and experiences whether I agreed with them or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I noticed in the comments people are wondering what I ended up deciding. I am leaning towards the side gig but to be honest, deciding to rejoin the work force (even on a part time\/freelancing basis) is a major decision that I cannot quickly and impulsively make.","answer":"I am glad you made this post to give some much needed and very important perspective on different starting points of financial journeys. I like your baseball analogy, and it sounds like your fiancee has a killer batting arm to have made it this far. Many others under the same circumstances would be drowning in debt or other problems. \n\nI hope that we get an update on your situation on how things are going for you two, one that doesn't have to address crappy misogynistic assumptions. But its also understandable that you don't want to post on this account anymore. Good luck to you both!"}
{"question":"FUD Altert: Gamestop iS gOiNg dOwN if the market crashes Seeing countless posts that Gamestop will be crashing with the market.\n\nWelcome to this weekends FUD campain. Let me explain why this is bullsh*t:\n\n1. Gamestop is the perfect hedge because Apes own the float and Apes don't have margin pressure.\nOn Friday Gamestop decreased because of shorting, not because the whole market bled.\n\n\"The whole market is going down that is why Gamestop is also bleeding\" saying is FUD!\n\nThey might need to short it further as the market crashes (to reduce margin pressure) but with every new short they create additional margin pressure, once they need to role or cover ETF or options exposure.\n\nCorrelation does not mean causation!\nThey use the market crash topic to continue shorting.\n\n2. A market crash has the potential to force shorts to close. Easy as it is. A failed margin call can be the beginning of the MOASS\n\n3. Rollover period: We know that they still have to roll to avoid fail to delivers in the millions of shares. As Gherkinit and other speculated they might even need to cover their options and ETF exposure (which they did not last week) on Monday.\n\n\nGamestops share price declines only in two cases: \n1. Retail sells which is not happening\n2. Marketmakers and Short hedgefunds short more and can avoid buying.\n\nThey are a few institution long, but without proof of them selling additional shares saying that they cause a bleed is also FUD.\n\nTL;DR:\nAny \"the market is crashing that is why Gamestop is crashing\" with it is bullshit, because apes sit on the long site of this stock. A stock is not \"just crashing\". There is always a short sell or real sell necessary (or some sort of forbidden darkpool fuckery with a small volume of shorted shares)\n\nPS: and turning the buy button off, was, based on the true reasons, illegal, not legal.\n\nEdit: I am not saying Gamestop will only go up or give you any date. I simply don't know. What I am saying is that \"the market goes down must mean that GME goes down\" is not a valid reasoning in my opinion","answer":"I said it once and I'll say it again, the lower the price, the faster the float gets DRSed. Sure they might lower the price while everything crashes but, they can't lower it too much as us retards will being buying as much as we can.\n\nEdit: Holy Fuck, I didn't think yall would give me this many updoots.

They already supported listings overseas when they announced that the VIE structure was legal and companies could do it as long as they run it by the government first. The action also supports that they want institutional investors. \nThey've been stating for weeks, both the SEC and Chinese Securities regulatory, that talks around auditing were \"positive\" and that they hope to get a resolution soon. \n\nI get that markets can be illogical but it's mad to me that despite the facts and actions being right there that FUD and headlines win out."}

The dips of the past week have certainly helped many of us load up on some additional shares, and it's great to see so many of them leaving the DTCC's vaults and heading out to ComputerShare where they cannot be used to further manipulate the price.\n\nOf course, there are *many* signals that the next few weeks are going to be huge for Apes. Earnings is reported after close tomorrow. Citadel is reducing the ability of their clients to withdraw funds, which of course shows that they see a grim future ahead.

{"question":"Thoughts on \u201cSuper Farms\u201d? I was looking at avalanche dapps and came across the Pangolin dex which went through a good boost earlier wrt liquidity this month. Doing a little more research, I [read](https:\/\/vireviews.com\/pangolin-dex-introduces-the-super-farm-program-offering-up-to-10-token-rewards-on-a-single-farm\/) that they are going to launch \u201csuper farms\u201d, which is what they call a new version of yield farming that lets you earn multiple tokens for liquidity provision. Nothing new right?\n\nExcept they will allow you to earn up to TEN TOKENS simultaneously. I haven't\u2019 seen any other platform offer this, but I could be wrong there. The basic reward is the $PNG token + the other token, but the pangolin team says that developers can add multiple tokens on top of that.

If i wanted to split 1k among 3\/4 etfs, and DRIP them for the next 40-50 years, where do you think i should divide it, and why? I think there's a 'trinity' of etfs i've heard about here. Anyway, again this would be DRIPing for decades (aside from her reg stocks and crypto). I hope she can look back on this, and maybe contribute to it in the future, with satisfaction in the years to come. Thanks!","answer":"That's a really hard question to answer tbh. 1k could be millions or less than $100,000  over that long of a period of time .

{"question":"Cutting losses early vs letting them expire? When it comes to options, especially selling premium, I've heard conflicting viewpoints about this. tastyworks and optionsalpha typically say to let the losers run because probabilities may play out in the end. But some books and other sources I've come across say to cut them early (around 100% loss if you're selling premium) and move on?\n\nSo what's better to do?","answer":"I don't usually like to just close things for a loss, I'd rather add hedges, adjust size, strikes, or time, then close the whole thing for a net profit. I see trades as just a bunch of layers. I can add or subtract layers to a loser, hedge my delta by adjusting strikes or adding\/removing strikes if I'm losing from directional moves, hedge vega or gamma with some long units, etc. I guess that's a long way to say if I'm selling premium I don't like to close losers early. There's just so many ways you can manage trades. \n\nThe exception is if I see a binary event\/black swan occurring, the underlying is just crushing my strikes or something I'll just go flat and look to make money elsewhere.\n\nI think in the end you have to learn what works for you and what you feel comfortable with. You might like just closing things and not having to think about them if they're not going your way.\n\nEdit: you should have a sense of what max loss you're comfortable with, and if you're trading undefined risk strategies you should close when you hit that point. BUT prior to that you should be doing the things you can to change your position into a winner."}

You can't just sell your illiquid assets overnight.\n\nI would imagine the majority of the \u00a3260k you quote is made up of property value - after all, [about two thirds](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/543443\/house-owners-among-population-uk\/) of people own their own home, and the [average value of a property is about \u00a3230k](https:\/\/landregistry.data.gov.uk\/app\/ukhpi).

So we know that if a company continuously spends more revenue than it receives then the company eventually is forced to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSo we also know that a country cannot file Chapter 11. Instead, it enters a crisis. many countries, specifically Latin American, have obviously encountered this. In which case they stopped paying back their debt, they subsequently stopped finding a financier, and were forced to print more money.\n\nMy question is why does this not happen to the US? In 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 - the US spent more than it received. How can US get away with this when no other country\/corporation\/etc can?","answer":"Because people trust the U.S. and are willing to lend it money. Debt for countries and corporations comes in the form of bonds, and in order to issue bonds, people\/entities need to be willing to buy those bonds. The U.S. creates the USD, and since people\/entities very much trust the US government's stability\/strength of institutions, they are willing to purchase these bonds from the government, giving the government cash in exchange for interest and principal at a later date. \n\nThis sounds odd, but so long as the U.S. maintains its strong\/stable institutions there's no reason to necessarily worry about the nominal amount of debt. The more important questions are: (1) Is the debt being put to productive use? and (2) Is inflation under control? These two questions help bring light to a nation's debt sustainability assuming it both creates its own currency and can denominate debt in said currency. \n\nI hope this helps."}

The highest daily volume in Jan was on 1\/22 with 197 million shares traded. Its much harder to explain that figure as legitimate shares being traded, because the entire company would have to exchange almost every share 3 times. The way hedge funds counter a dramatic and rapid increase in stock price is through shorting, and the pattern in GME and other heavily shorted stocks looks exactly like that. It's more likely that hedge funds were naked shorting millions of shares to suppress the price, which still went up until Robinhood halted retail buying.*\n\n*After that, their only option to get the situation under control was to cause a panic sell and bankrupt the company. If they couldn't tank the company and convince people to sell their positions, it would allow the buyer of those phantom shares to vote at the annual shareholder meeting. We saw flash crashes, short selling on circuit breaker events, and additional short selling when hedge funds were supposedly covering.. It started to look like they were desperate, which we knew they were.*\n\n*So.... By hodling through these events and voting at the meeting, we now have the most transparent way to illustrate the effects of their market f\\*uckery.*\n\n*I think people (including myself) are going to be surprised by the number of votes cast this year. People like Carl Hagberg serve as proxy election specialists and audit the process to ensure everything checks out. He is considered one of the country's leading authorities on annual meeting matters. When the situations described above start to show up, its damned-near impossible to explain it any other way.*\n\n*Hedgies R F\\*cked*\n\n\ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\udc50\"    - u\/atobitt, describing how Hedgies r fukd\n\nAlso...\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g97nzfg35my61.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2705c87a199719ad0ea524d523061388555145f7\n\n# \u2705VOTE YOUR SHARES AND GET YOUR FLAIRS!\u2705\n\n**Drop a comment below with !apevote! to get your special vote flair**\n\nEUROAPES GOT A FLAIR!!

{"question":"Landlords, how would you feel if your tenant asked you about real estate investing? I have a good (albeit fairly superficial) relationship with my landlord of 6+ years. I really like the apartment I rent, but I'm considering investing in real estate in the future (next several years). My landlord has a good reputation in my area and has been great to deal with. I'm interested in talking to her about her experiences in RE investing, but I don't want her to think I'm a flight risk. I'm just trying to learn to see if this is a path I want to go down. Current landlords - how would you feel if your tenant asked to talk to you about RE? Would you be open to it, or would it raise a red flag?","answer":"I always get really excited when one of my tenants say that they are interested in buying a home. Often people who are successful receive joy from seeing other people try to be successful as well.  \n\nI don't expect my tenants to stay with me forever. Some of them have stayed with me for 10 years or more, and some stay for only a year. Yes, I wish they would all stay for decades but the reality is that people don't and I have no desire to hold anyone back. I'm thrilled when someone says they want to be a homeowner and I am happy to share information with them in any way I can."}
{"question":"PTO requested. PTO approved. PTO used. PTO denied a week after the fact. Is that even legal? PTO was approved, and I spent the day at home watching my kid due to lack of available childcare that day.  Now, I am being told that I can't use it because it would bring my hours for the week to over 32.","answer":"I think that the key aspect of this post which many commenters have missed is that your PTO should *never* have been approved in the first place.\n\nThink about it: your job stipulates that you can work up to 32 hours per week (please correct me if I'm wrong in my understanding). PTO counts as worked hours. That means that any hours you actually work during the week plus PTO cannot add up to more than 32 hours. In some states, this is a big deal legally, because working over a certain amount of hours per week entitles you to benefits like healthcare. This was the case for me with a PT job that I worked in NY.\n\nIt's shitty that the system is set up this way, but that's the way it's set up. Your employer was in the right, because you front-loaded your hours earlier in the week which, combined with your PTO, would have exceeded the 32 hour per week cap, and may have exposed the company to legal penalties.\n\nSomebody made a mistake approving your PTO, and then someone corrected that mistake.\n\n&gt;I took three days off over a weekend, so Th,Fr, &amp; Mo. On the first week, I worked 26 hours Mo-We, and saw today that all but 6 of my PTO hours were stripped. On the second week, I worked 30 hours Tu-Fr, and had all but 2 of my PTO hours stripped. For a total strip of 16 hours this upcoming check.\n\nTo put the question another way--if you worked 26 hours Monday - Wednesday in a regular week where you didn't take off, how many hours would you have worked on Thursday and Friday? My guess is that the answer is 6. In a normal work week, would you always work 26 of your 32 hours in the first 3 days? My guess is that you wouldn't.\n\nI'm not judging, but it kind of seems like you were hoping to use PTO to get more worked hours than you're supposed to, and it didn't work out as planned. That's fine, but that also means that what your employer did is justified.\n\nApologies if I've got it wrong. Best of luck with your employer OP!"}
{"question":"How to turn down a promotion? Long story short, I have been approached by my director for a promotion to supervisor, in which I would have 10 full time employees under me.  In addition to my new responsibilities, I will have to continue doing my current technical job and all the responsibilities associated with it because management does not want to backfill my position.  I have been offered a 2% increase in pay for this promotion.\n\nPersonally, I do not feel the additional work and responsibility is worth only a 2% increase to my salary.  I would be interested in and happy to take the promotion and am stating my case for better compensation before I decide; however, I do not see the current offer as a fair deal.  I would be doing a job worth between $60-80k plus benefits on the open market in addition to what I am already doing, while only being compensated a minute fraction of that.\n\nIf my negotiations fail, I do not think I would want to trouble myself with all the extra work for so little extra pay.  How can I tactfully decline this promotion?  I really like my job, am treated well here, and do not plan on leaving regardless of the outcome of this situation.  As such, I do not want to jeapordize my current job in turning this down.  All responses are greatly appreciated, thank you!\n\nEdit:  This garnered far more comments than I expected.  I do not have time to respond to every single one but I want you all to know I have read every single comment (and continue to read the new ones), and appreciate you all taking your time to share your knowledge, experiences and opinions.  I\u2019ll post an update once everything is resolved so anyone who is interested can find out the outcome.  As one comment said, the consensus seems to be \u201cf*** you, pay me\u201d.  I think I\u2019ll go with a more tactful version of that and see where it goes.","answer":"I\u2019m surprised to see people even suggesting 10% is reasonable.  It\u2019s not.  Managing 10 people is no joke - you\u2019re in charge of all HR, quality control (buck stops with you), mentoring, etc.  In addition to your regular role!\n\n40% is very reasonable here.  Settle on 25% at the minimum.  Know your worth - 10% is insanity for this. "}
{"question":"Why is the overwhelming crypto sentiment on Reddit so negative outside of crypto subs? Do you think it\u2019s an accurate representation of sentiment in the general population? Visit any thread about crypto outside of crypto specific subs and its unbelievably negative. Everyone has essentially written it off as something between gambling and a scam, with phrases like \u201cgreater fools\u201d echoing from thread to thread. There isn\u2019t even a hint of rhetoric resembling open discourse about the crypto space in the comments.\n\nI\u2019m wondering how we arrived at such a divisive place, if we should be worried that the rhetoric is becoming overwhelmingly negative and polarized, and if Reddit is analogous main stream sentiment. \n\nPart of what gives anything value is the belief that it has value. As amazing as the theory and tech side of crypto is, with its potential to revolutionize and disrupt archaic systems, if people simply emotionally decide it\u2019s worthless, then it could become a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts.\n\nCurious what this community thinks about this.","answer":"I think it absolutely is.\n\nThe biggest turnoff imo is how the same people spouting its prospective use as a currency are the same people who buy it in hopes of selling it down the road at a higher price.. and, in fact, not using it as a currency at all.. which is imo incredibly ironic"}
{"question":"So anyone can now split off Bitcoin and create 7 billion of market valuation out of thin air?

So let us maybe fork Bitcoin 10 more times and we will have 1 trillion total market cap valuation in no time.\n\nDoes this even make sense?","answer":"you need the necessary hashpower, manpower, technical know how  (replay protection, difficulaty adjustment etc.) and political influence to do something with bitcoin. If you think it's so easy, try it for yourself.\n\nIn the next weeks, we will see how both bitcoins will be valued."}
{"question":"I've completely ruined my credit at 22 and my mental health led to EXTREME neglect of bills and I don't even know how to start digging myself out. PLEASE HELP ME. So basically, my mom passed away when I was 16 and I've been on my own ever since. I've had zero real world financial guidance as my mom was sick through my teens and she was a single mom of 2 kids. I couldn't keep up with bills and used credit cards to survive for a couple years. I've always only been able to afford the minimum payments so I've never really made headway paying them off. I was okay like that for a bit until I took a huge pay cut and couldn't make it anymore. I took out several payday loans over the last year and am in way over my head. I also had a huge lapse in mental\/physical help (diagnosed borderline personality disorder and manic depressive) and it basically led to a total shut down where I just stopped paying my bills for months in order to survive off my paycheck and just feeling completely lost \/hopeless, coupled with wasting money in unhealthy coping mechanisms.

Thank you all so much.","answer":"This year you don't make $28k, you make $24k. That's about $2k a month - can you cover all your essential bills, travel costs and groceries on that?\n\nIf so, you have a spare $4k over the course of the next year. In reality you won't pay all your debt off quite that fast because (a) nobody has zero unexpected costs for a whole year and (b) the debts will all keep gaining interest - but if you act like $2k per month is your income and seriously live off that the best you can, you can be debt free in 18 months. \n\nGo to your court summons, be polite and apologetic and explain your situation. They want to help you pay it back, they don't want to screw you over. List the debts from highest to lowest interest rate and pay them off in that order. Breathe. You're going to be ok."}

{"question":"How much of your happiness do you sacrifice by working, and do you feel like your salary justifies that? A couple of days ago, this poster here on r\/fire mentioned [that his new \"cushy\" job changed his perspective](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/8vd6s0\/new_cushy_job_no_longer_want_to_fire\/) so much that he wasn't that interested in RE anymore.\n\nHe switched from a soul-crushing job which he hated to something that was much more easy going (even though it paid less).\n\nIt made me think about the following concept:\n\n**How much of our happiness do we sacrifice by working?**\n\nBefore the switch, this poster sacrificed a lot of his happiness for his job, and he was completely miserable because of it. Reading from his post, no salary would be able to justify that huge sacrifice. So he switched.\n\nNow he has a job that's still slightly boring, but the happiness sacrifice is far less and it seems from his post that he's much happier since he made the switch.\n\nI have been VERY intrigued by this concept of happiness vs. work\/salary. That's why I wanted to start a discussion here.\n\nI have opened Microsoft paint and created [this graph to help get the ball rolling](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/74gQ3sL).\n\nTo use the same example as before, the old job of the previous reddit post was probably far above the linear line: Yes, it may have earned more, but (s)he was suffering every day because of that old job. His\/her new job is in much better territory, despite paying less. (correct me if I'm wrong, u\/ispace888 ! ;-))\n\nI want to ask all of you to determine where your current job is located on this chart. And as a follow-up, I'd like to ask how strongly you are pursuing FIRE. I bet the people who are in the red area on this chart are trying to reach FIRE much quicker, and thus have a higher saving rate.\n\n**As for me:**\n\nI've been pretty happy at my work over the last 3.5 years. Being the engineer that I am, I have gone ahead and [analysed just how happy I am at work in this essay](https:\/\/www.trackinghappiness.com\/happy-at-work\/). **TLDRL:** My work can be quite boring, stressful and intensive at times, but overall, I know that the impact on my happiness is not that big (0.12 points). This is why I am actually pretty happy with my job and salary. As a result, I'm not saving as aggresively as some others here are. Yes, I'm still frugal and aiming to become financially independent, but I'm not aggresively saving towards early retirement (or at least not yet!).\n\nI would love to start a discussion here on this topic, and see where the r\/fire community is located on this happiness-sacrifice vs. salary chart. Hell, it'd be amazing if we could create a big community-filled scatter chart with each and every one of your jobs, but I guess that's just me being a dreamer ;-)\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nUpdate: Thanks r\/fire for the MANY insights, anecdotes and stories.

And no amount of money is equal compensation for time( again, in my case) unless the job was dedicated to the betterment of mankind( i.e cancer research). I make good money now but it's a glorified corporate 'paper-shifting across my desk' job and everyday I feel as though it's a day lost doing ultimately meaningless shit.

{"question":"My Heart Breaks Last night my gf just fell apart on the floor. We were talking about this winter season, and how everything just costs money. Want to go for a walk? Spend money on water. Want to go see some friends? Travel costs money. Want to do ANYTHING? Spend money on something.\n\nMy gf doesn't make a lot of money, and I've been the bread winner, but it just sucks. I want to make more so she can breathe a little, and have some fun for once. Last night she told me \"It feels like I'm just supposed to work my ass off so someone else can make money. If that's the truth of our world, then what's the point in my existence?\"\n\nIt broke my heart to see how destroyed she felt. How utterly broken this capitalistic world is, and how a person with a beautiful mind, soul, and heart can feel so useless. Like she's this amazing woman, and she feels like unless she makes 7 figures she has zero importance in this world.\n\nI'm just tired of it never being enough...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people making repeat statements, so I'll elaborate after a nights sleep. Some of the examples I gave were hyperboles, and not a literal example. I was just trying to illustrate my frustration that it feels impossible to live in this world without spending money. We don't make 6 figures on our combined salaries (some of you are really upset at thinking we do...), but again that was hyperbole about the current state of our nation (we looked into what we would need to make to buy a home where we live, and making $100,000 annually is barely enough to not get laughed at by a mortgage lender). \n\nWe live extremely frugally: 1 bed\/bath apartment, no kids, no pets, no table for eating, we have internet and 2 subscriptions, we use tap through a Britta filter, we do 95% of our own cooking and 'splurge' on Chipotle once a month, lots of meal preps for when we leave the house to cut down on expenses, we haven't been to a movie theatre since End Game, the only travel we've done in the last 3 years is when my father passed away and I had to reconcile his estate, my work even pays for my cell phone. ","answer":"I\u2019m a little confused, you started with not being able to afford water\u2026 and ended with if you aren\u2019t making 7 figures you are worthless\u2026\n\nThere a whole hellavu lot of in between there. If you both can really not afford to do anything (which is how it sounds as the cost of water is going to be about as cheap as things that cost money get), then you should both be spending your time figuring out how to increase your income. That\u2019s how everyone affords things, they figure out ways to make more money, it\u2019s a huge world out there and in the internet age, opportunity is just a click away."}
{"question":"Verifying that a mortgage offer is not too good to be true I recently submitted applications with 5 banks for a mortgage. One of them came in with a far lower rate than the others. I asked their loan officer why the rates are so low, and they claim that it is because they are financing the loan themselves and are able to offer better rates to gain marketshare. They said this is new since they are under new management within the past year and trying to rebuild their portfolio. Obviously, if this is true I want to go with them, because it will save me a lot of money in interest.\n\nPros: I checked it with my real estate agent, my real estate lawyer (who has done deals that included them before), and one of the other banks I've been talking to. They all said it sounded like a good deal and that this bank should be able to handle the mortgage. I also checked the Better Business Bureau, and they have an A+ rating as a bank.\n\nCons \/ Concerns: The 5th bank I applied to called me back today (later than the other 4) and when I told them the rate I already got, they strongly implied that this other bank must be breaking fair lending laws to give out such a good rate, that the rate is too good to be true, and that this bank has been running similar market share offer deals for 15 years. Separately, I also see several customer complaints about them and in general they are not well rated online (but, most of the issues seem to be about bad customer experience and bad online account options, not issues related to mortgage rates.)\n\nSo, should I trust the sources that I checked, or should I still be suspicious of this deal? Is there anything else I can do to assure myself that this is a \"real\" rate that will not fall through or have legal issues? \n\nThanks for any advice!\n\nEDIT TO ADD: This is a 30-year fixed mortgage.\n2nd EDIT: The rate does not require buying any points.","answer":"So another mortgage company is speaking poorly about competition and that concerns you?\nMost businesses have complaints, it\u2019s what they do to resolve them that matters. \n\nIf the people who you have hired are giving you the go-ahead, then that\u2019s your answer."}
{"question":"Since Crashes Are Inevitable...Should I Save Cash for the Next Bubble Burst? It seems that historically the market crashes every 10-20 years, with minor bubbles in between. 87,2001,2008.\n\nUnfortunately during the last crash I was just getting out of college and looking for work so I had no money to invest. Since then I have invested successfully in a few companies as well as made a few bad decisions. Nothing apocalyptic but I'd be lying if I said my results were fantastic. \n\nRight now I would say I have maybe 35% of my cash invested. The rest is making pretty much nothing which I realize is bad. However, going on my current belief that much of the market appears to be overvalued (I concede I may be wrong) would it make sense to hold off on some investments until another crash happens?\n\nLooking back on 2008-2009. Picking up almost any major stock around 2010 would have at least doubled if not quintupled your money. But if say had invested in 2006 then most of those gains would have just been coming back to even. I guess I don't want to get in a situation where I am investing at the peak, but I also realize I may be leaving profit and gains on the table right now.\n\nIf anyone has any good suggestions\/criticisms or articles to read on any strategy let me know. If this was colossally misinformed, well fuck. My bad.","answer":"This question keeps coming up almost several times per day.  Here is the answer.\n\nTime in the market tends to beat timing the market.  If you try to time the market you might get lucky, or you might miss out.  Or worse yet, you might wait 2 years decide waiting was foolish and buy right at the peak.\n\nStocks lost about half their value in the 2008 crash, so the desire to avoid that or to buy at the bottom makes a lot of sense.  But you should also know that Bonds (or at least the BND ETF) lost only 6% of their value during the 2008 crash.\n\nSo broadly you have 3 options\n\n* Keep your money in cash.  You'll lose some to inflation, but not too much.  Maybe you'll get luck and time the market correctly.  Your worst case senior isn't too bad.  You could get luck and buy in at the perfect time.  You probably won't, but you could.  And if you do, you'll beat every other strategy by a lot.  Its a gamble.  You'll probably end up missing out.\n* Go all in on stocks for the long haul.  You could be buying at a peak which wouldn't be great.  It could take 10 years to recover, but if you are investing for 30 years, that's fine.  Ride it out.\n* Balance between stocks and bonds.  If there is a crash it'll hurt, but you'll be able to sell you bonds (at a slightly reduced prices) to buy stocks at a greatly reduced price.  On the other hand if today is the lowest value that stocks will ever be, you'll do pretty well.  You'll make money on both your stocks and bonds.  You'll make less than if you were all in on stocks, but you protected yourself from the crash so that's okay. The question remains what percentage should be in stocks and what should be in bonds?  And that's up to you.\n\nPersonally, I'm leaning heavy towards option 3.  Option 1 seems WAY to risk averse.  Option 2 seems way to dangerous, because it really does seem like the market is overvalued.  Option 3 seems just right.  You'll do well in a crash (assuming you have the courage to sell your well performing bonds to buy the stocks, and then hold onto those stocks) and you'll do well in if the good times just keep on rolling.  \n\nThis is a pretty vanilla investing strategy.  You decide on an allocation between stocks and bonds based how much risk you want, and anything that balance gets out of wack (like when stocks do down 50% but bonds only 6%) you re-balance.  this effectively lets sell high and buy low.  You can tweak it a little bit by altering the allocation.  Maybe you are scared now, so you want to go 50\/50.  if stocks crash you'll go 60\/40.  If they fall even more go 70\/30 and stay there forever.\n\nIf you want to get a little more advanced you can, along with US stocks and bonds, mix in REITs, International developed stock, and emerging stocks or even things like gold or bitcoin.\n\nEdit: I think Sokpuppet1 made a good point.  What I said only applies if you have a lot of money that you want to get invested quickly or if you have a large portfolio (relative to your goals) and want to exploit or protect yourself from a crash.  If you are saving some percentage of your paycheck each month for retirement, then just keep doing that.  You will buy at the peak and at the trough and it will balance out.  Getting a life cycle fund and making monthly contributions is a fantastic strategy and its where the vast majority of my money is. \n"}
{"question":"Lost 100k today in 3 minutes. I am a fucking idiot and I truly hope I am the only one today who was fucking retarded. I put in a MARKET order call by accident with a shit ton of money and lost my money while trying to sell too swiftly back into the market immediately after buying. I was stunned.

{"question":"Out preforming the market including short term capital gains taxes? Like most, I joined this community within the last couple of months and have begun wheeling with varying degrees of success. And have not been beating the market for the ETFs that I have been wheeling because they have performed so well. I understand this bull run the last few months is unheard of and not typical. So here is my question, is wheeling returns better than just buying and holding especially when you factor in capital gains taxes. When I hold longterm I Can take advantage of long term capital gains taxes. So when wheeling I not only need to beat the market but I need to beat it by more than 10% for it to be worth it. Not including the increase in the amount of time spent researching for wheeling.\n\nMy question is has anyone else thought of anything like this? I guess I'm just questioning if it's all worth it for me. I'd love to hear your opinion about this.","answer":"By design, options shouldn\u2019t beat their benchmark underlying. Wheeling is no different.\n\nWhy?\n\nFor starters, equity and volatility are two different asset classes (some may argue the latter). They simply perform differently.\n\nWhen a trader sells options they trade growth potential for lower volatility. In a perfect world the returns are muted less than the volatility, yielding an increase in sharpe ratio. In practice this is not always the case.\n\nDeferred capital gains is a massive benefit and performance contributor of buy\/hold. One could trade section 1256 contracts and receive a bit of a tax break but it\u2019s moot if one has a marginal tax rate of 22%. Might as well take a fifth of your profits and throw them out the window.\n\nA chief use case for retail folks is (early) retirement. Taxes can be optimized to virtually nothing and it\u2019s a viable strategy to mitigate sequence of returns risk. BIgERN has an excellent series on safe withdrawal rates and short options are very much part of his early retirement income strategy."}

{"question":"Am i responsible for tenants flat tires I have tenants that have been living in a property I own for over a year now. Today I got a text message saying that they discovered a bunch of nails on the gravel parking pad at the back of the house. \n\nThey told me that they have had three flat tires since they've moved in and believe that this is the cause.

I put in what I could of Citadel, and people really don\u2019t seem to want to do much with them! Housing Bubble is growing\u2026 take a look! Other than that.. you know the drill! Reading holds the key to the map!

I have found quite a few institutions have 13F filings for Citadel, but no one actually wants to have any ownership of them. So far Wells Fargo, JP Morgan and Bank of America are the ones that are taking a chance on them ( at least from what I have found..). I have also found the 17 broker\/dealers that utilize APEX Clearing as their clearinghouse! Interestingly enough, Robinhood does not fall on this list. I will be adding the other broker\/dealers and their clearing houses soon.\n\nSome of the names that stuck out to me are M1 finance, Webull, WealthSimple, Ally, and Firstrade\n\nI have not completed the ones who have a PFOF with Citadel, but it\u2019s coming. (I am only 1 person).\n\nIf you cruise on up to the purple\/red bubbles you will see that Citadel has not only shares bought in Vanguard and Blackrock, but they have also decided to place options on them as well. Doing what hedgies do best, I guess.\n\nMoving on up to the north side of Citadel\u2019s bubble, we see 1 13 D\/A filing (there are more, but not relevant to this\u2026). I found that they have a little bit of control ownership in Susquehanna! The same one that is up with our good friend GAMESTOP!\n\nCitadel is truly the only one I could pin down to being at the center of the mess going on, and the other hedge funds do not have any major link to them.\n\nTHIS IS A GOOD THING!\n\nThe more I tried to find the bearish side against AMC and GME, the more I found that they had even MORE backing on the bullish side.\n\nAt the very top, where my random banks were, we see Charles Schwab has 1.23 Million shares of Gamestop and 1.77 Million shares of AMC. They also have 13F filings for Vanguard and BlackRock. Moving over to the left I found that Bank of America had 13 G\/A filings from Berkshire Hathaway (a whopping 1.032 BILLION Shares), Vanguard, and BlackRock. BofA also had investments in BlackRock and Vanguard (along with Citadel and Point72). There are others, but this map would NEVER end.\n\nDeutsche Bank had a 13 D\/A filing from BlackRock and had a 13F filing for Citadel.\n\nFrom what I kept seeing, MOST of the banking institutions have some form of investment into Citadel! Concerning? Not really\u2026 Because the almost all that has been invested is so tiny that the banks may only feel a slight pinprick from their investment, in the event Citadel ceases to exist.\n\nThe powerhouses are proving to be on the right side of history this time, which is good for economic purposes.\n\nOr are they?\n\nPart 3.\n\nIf you notice, there are two new bubbles coming from Vanguard: Invesco and BlackStone.\n\nWe know Invesco Kenna\u2026 But who is BlackStone?\n\nI am SO happy you have asked that question! Let\u2019s head down to the Housing Bubble that is forming.\n\nI am so thankful for my husband for helping to piece a lot of this together! His background? He is a realtor himself and enjoys tracking the market! He started noticing some dangerous trends within the market itself and wanted to dig more into it! He started this research a couple months ago and found that we are gearing towards ANOTHER 08 situation.\n\nPeople are taking out more subprime mortgages recently, and the fascinating thing is\u2026 that it is for rentals! Rental homes have a little more leniency on borrowing since it is for income, and the big investment institutions figured that out. BlackStone SOLD the FIRST single family rental securitization in 2013 for $479 Million!\n\nI Could do an ENTIRE write up, but my husband did an EXCELLENT job dictating his points ON the map\u2026 So, I will leave you be for a moment to follow the chart!\n\nThe only Key you need for that section:\n\nSubprime Mortgages:\n\nGreen- STILL AVAILABLE (one way or another, it could be tricky\u2026 but there are lenders for these)\n\nRed- NO LONGER AVAILABLE\n\n\\-\n\n\\-\n\n\\-\n\nWelcome Back!! Hope you found that interesting!\n\nThe last thing for this DD is the Housing Insurance Bubble!\n\nA few months ago, we saw whispers of notable names from the \u201808 era looking into a bubble revolving around homeowner\u2019s insurance. The idea was that Climate Change affected zip codes would see an increase in their premium costs. In turn, the monthly cost would be substantially higher than what the owner originally agreed upon. Between the pandemic, and people normally taking out the max they can borrow, their shoestring budget becomes even thinner! Therefore, while interest on the mortgages were low, people in areas where fires, hurricanes, floods and\/or tornados occur would see their payments fluctuate drastically! The unfortunate side effect will be people being unable to make their payments, and we could see more people being foreclosed on!\n\nIf you will go to the bubble just south of the CDO\/BTO web, you will find my area where I am starting to gather article and will be posting stats for updating purposes!\n\nPlease note: ALL OF THIS APPLIES to commercial real estate as well as residential!\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through everything and follow along! As far as I can see we are heading towards something pretty incredible\u2026 and history books will talk about this for centuries!\n\nBe kind to one another!\n\nLastly\u2026 TO. THE. MOON!!","answer":"Holy shit am I reading this right? If this bubble pops, it\u2019s going to be because landlords are defaulting?

{"question":"Satori: The First 36 Hours Hey all. How\u2019s everybody doing?\n\n\nWhat an absolutely surreal experience.\n\n\nSatori has now been live officially for 36 hours, and quite honestly the process has vastly exceeded our expectations. We cannot express the level of joy and validation that we\u2019ve received over the past 2 days in being able to interact with you while we\u2019re all riding on the back of our Mind-Reading Monkey Friend.\n\n\nWe know that there\u2019s still so much coming, and we have absolutely no intention of resting on our laurels (other projects are already under way.) We did, however, share an absolutely delightful moment as a team earlier thinking of the emergency meetings that were called today because of us. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a direct translation in Ape Speak for schadenfreude, but whatever that word is, we were swimming in it today.  \n\n\nThe team wanted to take a moment to review what\u2019s happened, and give some additional clarification about our initial reveal. \n\n\nWe\u2019re still collecting specific data about the impact of Satori's activation, and therefore I can\u2019t offer quantifiable evidence to say that we know that there\u2019s a difference made already. However, from the number of posts, comments, and messages we\u2019ve received about people already noticing a difference have been hard to pass off as simple happenstance. The feel of the entire sub has changed, and you Apes deserve so much of the credit for that. We sincerely hope that the results of our labors will continue to support your trust in us. \n\n\nI\u2019d forward you all to the F.A.Q. section that was curated by u\/Bradduck_Flyntmoore about Satori in today\u2019s Jungle Beat by u\/pinkcatsonacid. The majority of concerns have been covered there, and the dev team would like to extend a special thanks to u\/Bradduck_Flyntmoore for curating that process on launch night. We weren\u2019t sure what exactly to address in our original statement. Now that we\u2019ve been able to gauge how our announcement has been received, two things have stood out that we feel need additional information and clarification. \n\n\nAt its core, Satori is an information gathering system designed to expedite the process of moderators identifying bad actors within the sub. While some of the steps have been automated through Reddit for ease of implementation, Satori by itself is incapable of acting autonomously. It merely \u201creads minds.\u201d The decisions on how to enforce based on the information Satori provides lies firmly in the hands of the Mods. Satori, as a system, cannot moderate without the direct assistance of a real person making the choice to utilize its information. In the same way Mods are accountable based on the Mod Log, all information gifted by Satori is trackable and reversible as necessary. Nothing is being done without significant oversight by the established leadership structure of the sub.\n\n\nApproved status only means that Satori has not detected known shill activities on your account. It is not an endorsement. It is not to be used like \u201ctrust me I'm an approved user.\u201d It simply means that the specific account has yet to behave shilly. Do not associate it with an additional level of trust. Be just as skeptical as you have been to this point. \n\n\nSatori has only started giving approved status. This process will take time. The list is very long and almost every single ape will be approved. Don't fucking go Star Bellied Sneeches on this. The order in which Approved status is being distributed has been completely arbitrary, aside from DFV after his first tweet yesterday. He got the special treatment. Mods will also be manually adding names to lists for Satori approval if they can spare the time, but everyone else will have to wait. Please do not harass the mods with requests as there is already a lot on their plate. This should not be a point of division, but rather unity. Citing Satori in ways that drive FUD into the community is a shill strategy, so call that shit out.\n\n\nWhat does it mean to be Approved? Simple: you bypass the karma and age requirements. This means you do not need to karma farm in order to meet the new requirements. Actually, this should allow more Apes to participate while still protecting the sub overall.\n \n\nOur time in the last months has been dedicated to preparing for launch, and we have not discussed what we will be doing with Satori afterwards in any significant detail. I would ask you all to consider this: every member of our development team holds shares in GameStop. We\u2019re all in possession of the most valuable asset on the planet already. We like the stock. We\u2019re aware that we\u2019re currently fighting one of the most corrupt systems on the planet; one based on greed, exploitation, and discrimination. We know the lives they\u2019ve ruined for their own gain. We have absolutely no intention of letting what we\u2019ve created be utilized by established powers to continue to abuse and exploit others. We know what having this type of technology in the hands of common people can mean, and we want the legacy of Satori to be one that we can be proud of for the rest of our lives, and for the ape community to feel the same. \n\n\nFinally, there\u2019s been several posts I\u2019ve personally commented on that have raised a very, very vital point. Satori is, by definition, a reactionary entity. It can only identify what it knows to be a threat. We\u2019ve spent three months working to make sure it has a very clear understanding of what all the threats to this point have been, but there will be new tactics, new shills, and new threats, so we will continue to need your help. The more insight we have about what moves the shills are making, the better Satori is going to be at identifying them. Satori will guard our flanks, and this means Apes no longer have to worry about anything besides identifying new strategies in order to keep Satori primed and ready for anything. Stay vigilant, and report things that seem contrary to ideal or normal Ape behavior. Give Satori your energy - get it to power level 9000. Satori is a direct result of the collective efforts of Apes over the past four months, and it will continue to be powerful as long as we maintain it as such. In a way, it is our collective consciousness. We are Satori. \n\n\nBuy. Hold. Vote. Fight. \n\n\nT.L.D.R. \nWhat a fucking great day. \n\nHedgies are angry, confused, and fuk. \n\nSatori is a powerful tool to be used by Mods, nothing more\n\nEvery member of r\/superstonk will be Approved. \n\nApproved status is not an endorsement.\n\nUsing Approved status to divide is shill behavior.\n\nWe will not allow Satori to be used to further oppress already oppressed populations. \n\nSatori is as powerful as we make it. \n\nDon\u2019t get complacent. \n\nThis community rocks so fucking hard. \n\nWe. Are. Satori.\n\nEdits: formatting on mobile","answer":"I was locked out of r\/superstonk over a month ago for not meeting karma requirements. I up and down voted my ass off the whole time!

If you are interested in the process I use below to evaluate a stock, check out* [How Do I Buy A Stonk???](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ASX_Bets\/comments\/lzjpvf\/how_do_i_buy_a_stock\/)\n\n# The Business\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6mdyrgkleu171.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=591f932dd7773dc0d3301b2a547e3e951f94e7f7\n\nThe Australian Mutual Provident society (AMP), was formed in 1849. It started out as a non-profit insurance company and mutual society. In 1998 it was listed on the ASX as a public company. For over 170 years AMP has provided insurance, banking, and wealth management, as well as has been a huge investor in real estate and infrastructure capital.\n\nAs part of their wealth management business, AMP manages large superannuation funds. At the start of 2020, between their 'Superannuation Savings Trust' and the 'Wealth Personal Superannuation and Pension Fund' (which they run), AMP served 1.8million super members across Australia. With 100 billion in assets at that time, it would have put them in the top 5 super providers by asset value.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, AMP also has one of the largest shareholder registers on the ASX exchange (ouch!). Currently, they have over 700k different shareholders on the books, of which more than half own less than 1k shares.\n\n# The Checklist\n\n* Net Profit: negative in 2 of the last 5 years. Bad \u274c\n* Outstanding Shares: significant cap raise 2019. Bad \u274c\n* Revenue, Profit, &amp; Equity: sharp decline last 5 years.

This historical fair value &amp; target buy price have no real relevance other than to give us a general idea on what the business used to be worth, on average.)\n\nIf anything, the above quick checklist really brings home the point that a business should be evaluated on more than just its basic valuation metrics. By nearly all counts, this is a terrible business to invest in. However, working off stuff like EPS and BPS exclusively, it would seem one is getting a great deal.\n\n# The Knife\n\n[marketindex.com.au](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g3gt5osdfu171.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79d67e45a99bf1cc4c5f2291984a7ce7894ec3d5)\n\nAt it\u2019s all time high in 2001, AMP\u2019s share price rose as high as $16 a share. AMP's fall from grace for the share price itself has evidently been long and arduous.\n\nThis decade, AMP enjoyed a more recent high in 2015 of over $6 a share. At that point, AMP\u2019s market cap was just under $20 billion, and they were considered one of Australia\u2019s top 20 largest public companies. Indeed, they were a member of the S&amp;P\/ASX20 index up until 2018.\n\nEarly 2018 marked the year of one of AMP's most dramatic collapses. Investors who had bought in the years leading up to that point, would at the close of Friday at $1.17 (28th May 2021), be down anywhere between 70% and 80% of their investment. Even had they bought AMP 1 year ago today, they would still down 30%.\n\n# The Diagnosis\n\nThe Short Answer: The Royal Commission on Banking &amp; Super funds dealt a serious and maybe fatal blow to AMP\u2019s reputation in the market.\n\nThe Long Answer: AMP\u2019s business is a cluster fuck and appears to have a major management and culture problems. These problems are quickly destroying a business, which had already been struggling for the last couple of decades.\n\n**Banking Royal Commission**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x9en6u6wfu171.png?width=3500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=236dfac144d12c07f2066bd468a5e976cca395e9\n\nAt the end of 2017, the Australian Federal government launched a royal commission into the misconduct in the banking, superannuation, and financial services industry. What they found were many instances of abuses by banks and financial institutions. Not many in the industry spared criticism of the commission, but perhaps the most damaging of these findings were the revelations that AMP was charging clients for financial advice that was not being provided.\n\nThe widespread and systematic nature of AMP\u2019s fee charging regime was no mistake, was not isolated, and had been occurring for many years. Direction for the illicit behavior appeared to have gone right up to some of the top echelons of management. On top of all of that, AMP were found to have mislead the ASIC on multiple occasions. The CEO of AMP at that time, Craig Meller, resigned. Many other board members also resigned in the years since, as the organization has struggled to try to renew its image and turn around the sinking ship.\n\n**Class Actions**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mhiss3h7gu171.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2ff71d13a271eff78875bdef924bcbf47fbf337\n\nThe commission proved to be only the opening salvo. A dogpile of plaintiffs emerged to take a bite out of the disgraced business. Several class action suits launched against AMP. Shareholders suing for loss of value in light of ASIC misrepresentations; insurance customers accusing AMP of overcharging on premiums; and former financial planners alleging breach of contracts. I believe of these the planner suit is still ongoing. Regardless of the tangible costs, perhaps the more long-term cost has been to exact an even steeper price from AMP\u2019s already damaged reputation.\n\n**ASIC Lawsuit**\n\nThe latest of the developments is the very recent news this week (27th March) that the ASIC has lodged a suit against AMP for allegedly charging premiums to dead people. They claim that AMP charged life insurance premiums and advice fees to more than 2000 deceased customers. Further, they alleged that AMP knew that these fees were being charged but did not try to fix the issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Like... a lot of them.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yzahhp2igu171.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a09d64e4ec07bbb2673fddda4309c7f83937fb3d)\n\nHonestly, trying to comprehensively assess all of the negative news regarding AMP has been almost impossible. The more I dig, the more I learn of some other major development in this saga. If anything, the latest news of charging dead customers is just more fuel on the burning dumpster fire that is AMP.\n\n# The Outlook\n\nNot good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Demergering the Businesses**\n\nComing away from the Royal Commission, the major strategic direction of the new CEO and AMP\u2019s management appears to have been to split up the business and sell off the viable parts. The first of which was their then loss-making insurance business. After 170 years in insurance, AMP sold the arm to Resolution Life, a Bermuda based company, for $3 billion. The irony is that they had to conduct a $650million capital raise just to have the funds necessary to piece together the demerger.\n\nOriginally the plan was to include the New Zealand based wealth management business in the sale, but that later was cut from the deal. It\u2019s not clear to me which party decided to walk away from that portion. Though AMP has still broadcast intentions to offload their New Zealand business unit eventually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tis but a scratch!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7uah7k1lgu171.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccb766053fe9d786047ed4d3448523b2c68ce4c6)\n\nThis year, AMP was preparing to sell a majority stake in AMP Capital (their infrastructure and real estate investment business) in a deal with Ares, a private equity firm in the US. This is after Ares initially looked to purchase AMP outright. Both deals have thus far fallen through, however. Since then, AMP has offloaded some of the individual capital investments to other firms like Lendlease.\n\nThese moves seem almost desperate, but when you look at their balance sheet, you can see why that might be the case. Their long-term debt is 600% larger than their total shareholder equity. Their current liabilities amount to about 25billion, while they only have about 3.3billion in current assets to cover those with.\n\nUltimately, AMP has indicated that they want to reduce the business to the Banking and Australian Wealth Management units only. Though that assumes AMP can complete its transformation plans without going insolvent first. The way things are shaping up, I could very well see the Banking side being cut away as well in a fire sale. Either way, when everything is said and done, there will not be very much left of the original Australian goliath.\n\n**Financial Planning Industry**\n\nWhat little is left will be heavily focused in an industry that has long been in decline: financial planning. Part of this decline is a changing of standards. One result of the commission was the federal government setting up FASEA (Financial Adviser Standards &amp; Ethics Authority). New rules coming into effect will increase the level of qualifications required to continue to operate as a financial planner. This will provide further barriers for new planners, and likely push some portion of those currently practicing out of the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Phasing in new qualification requirements](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/11fc660qgu171.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b348f422831ef6fcf54f5666921986e5bc160c8)\n\nThough, I think the writing has been on the wall for a long time as far as that goes. If anything, it will only hasten a decline that was well underway years prior to this. AMP had been cutting back heavily on their roster of financial planners for years even prior to the Commission, and things have only gotten worse since. Indeed, Friday (28th March) it was announced AMP plans to cutting an additional 20% of its staff to \u201cstreamline\u201d the business. Stinks of last ditch effort to stay afloat though.\n\n# The Verdict\n\nI think AMP\u2019s troubles extend far beyond simply a damning Royal Commission report and a gradual decline in an industry. If AMP\u2019s long-term strategy is to reduce the business to core banking and financial planning, then it leaves them in a strange position. Financial planning is essentially commoditizing advice. Banking is the safeguarding of other\u2019s money. They are both industries that rest upon a foundation of trust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Photo from The Australian](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fxfyb6hvgu171.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cb5bf78206152dcdd65e9d476ee11545b040bc9)\n\nWith AMP\u2019s name sullied by a string of accusations of unethical behavior, they\u2019ve become a pariah of the industry. I expect they will struggle to build on their client base, if they survive at all. The only optimistic angle I can find is if the wealth business is completely sold off and rebranded. And that evidently is not off the cards. AMP\u2019s name itself may be the ultimate casualty of management\u2019s questionable activity over the years.\n\n# The Target\n\nBut let\u2019s ignore all that for a moment and try to value this business as sits now. It turns out that is somewhat difficult. Part of the problem is that the business has been split of from their insurance business at this point, so the consolidated historical figures are largely irrelevant. So, to give it a proper valuation, we need to base it on estimates of AMP in the future. However, that is also clouded owing to an uncertainty over what will actually remain after the business is fragmented and portions are sold off.\n\nThat being said, we can get a baseline by limiting our focus only to the business segments that AMP have claimed they want to retain in the long term: the Australian wealth management and banking businesses.\n\nDetermining book value is also tricky, given a bulk of its assets are likely tied up in AMP Capital. Though, maybe we can use a rough estimate taking the FY20 equity ($4.27billion) and discounting it based on the proposed sale of a 60% stake in AMP Capital earlier in the year (at $1.35billion). This works out to be a $2.25billion grossed up value, which is just over half of their current book value.\n\nDividends would change long term as well. However, AMP has not paid any dividends in the last couple of years, so leaving them out of this evaluation seems appropriate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMP FY20 Annual Report](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cxwo3627hu171.png?width=997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ab9e02677c54caa007663c51a4489d50c13700)\n\nWorking off FY20 figures, AMP Bank in FY20 made $401million in revenue and out of that achieved a NPAT of $119million. AMP Aus Wealth Management in FY20 made $1,062million in revenue and out of that achieved a NPAT of $110million. Combined it comes to $1,463million revenue, $229million NPAT, and $2billion in equity. With 3,436million outstanding shares one gets the following stats:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* SPS 42.6cents\n* EPS 6.7cents\n* BPS 58.2cents\n\nThis would give us revised long term price targets of:\n\n**Fair Price (Long Term) - $1.09\\***\n\n**Target Price (Long Term) - $0.88\\***\n\n\\*Keep in mind, these price targets fail to factor in any additional fines and damages coming out of the currently unresolved lawsuits, and the result of those could be quite significant.\n\n# The TL;DR\n\nThe Banking Royal Commission turned out to be catastrophic for AMP, when it found that they had been ripping off customers for years and misleading the ASIC to boot. Since then, an army of skeletons have been jumping out of AMP\u2019s closet, further driving a stake into the heart of this dreadful business. AMP\u2019s problems are not structural *per se*, but the business appears to have an unrepairable internal culture and hopeless (to put it nicely) management.\n\nOne might be able to try to piece together the wreckage and find a fair value off what will be the core business when the dust settles (Wealth Management and Banking). I personally think the only opportunity for those holding this stock now is a complete breakup and sell off of the company. Luckily for them, this appears to a real potential, with a deal nearly getting done with a private equity firm earlier this year.\n\nIf so, there could be a light at the end of the tunnel for bagholders. In 2020, the USA listed Hertz car rental company announced that they were filing bankruptcy. Despite this, many people continued to buy their, at that point, $1.00 shares. The gamble paid off and shareholders are now set to be paid $8 per share when the company is sold off to two investment firms. Could AMP present a similar opportunity? It isn\u2019t clear. I feel bad for all of the bagholders that have been stuck holding this train-wreck, and so I hope it works out for them.\n\nTalks with private equity had the business as a whole potentially being sold for $1.80 per share. However, there\u2019s still a lot of baggage with potential additional external costs from fines and lawsuit damages that would erode this value. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t put $1 dollar into this stock under the circumstances. But if I were game for a punt, I\u2019d be waiting until the share was well below the net tangible book value ($1.06) before I even considered it.\n\n*As always, thanks for attending my ted talk and fuck off if you think this is advice.* \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n*I'd love to hear other's opinion on AMP and whether there is potential here that I am not seeing.

{"question":"lithium delivery for u\/username-taken82 The daily probably would've served for this[,](https:\/\/imgur.com\/JAcQnZ5) but a dose of lithium might perk up the [introspective username-taken82](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ASX_Bets\/comments\/zu46ue\/merry_christmas_cucks\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \nI think it's fair to say that we all share the disappointment of lifestyle directors that mentioning lithium pegmatites no longer adds $100m to explorers' market caps.\n\nI've discovered that there's about a **6 week turnaround on consumption of battery materials and selling an EV**, which explains the price action below pretty well.  \nCars need to be bought by 31st December to be eligible for subsidies, which matches the mid November peak. However, you'll also get a slight overflow of orders onto January waitlists, which probably accounts for the sustained strength through to the end of November. It matches Tesla's 2 week waitlist in China not so long ago, but no idea about BYD, who have far more models. At one point, their wait lists stretched out to about 2 months, which would've seen lithium pushing through this quiet period, but clearly, those have evaporated. I tried to keep track of it, but there just wasn't enough reliable data coming out, though the signs were there.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the Chinese New Year, it varies, and this year, takes place unusually early (Jan 22nd). So there should only be around 14 working days in January, meaning that it was always going to be a soft month for sales.\n\n|**Date**|**Battery grade**|**Technical LFP grade**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Dec 28|\u00a5536k\/t(9)|\u00a5506k\/t(8)|\n|Dec 21|\u00a5550k\/t(9)|\u00a5532k\/t(10)|\n|Dec 14|\u00a5569k\/t(11)|\u00a5547k\/t(11)|\n|Dec 07|\u00a5580k\/t(10)|\u00a5563k\/t(10)|\n|Nov 30|\u00a5588k\/t(10)|\u00a5575k\/t(11)|\n|Nov 23|\u00a5600k\/t(10)|\u00a5579k\/t(9)|\n|Nov 16|\u00a5601k\/t(10)|\u00a5585k\/t(8)|\n|Nov 09|\u00a5594k\/t(8)|\u00a5579k\/t(7)|\n|Nov 02|\u00a5584k\/t(8)|\u00a5567k\/t(10)|\n|Oct 26|(sparse trades)|(sparse trades)|\n|Oct 19|\u00a5549k\/t(7)|\u00a5537k\/t(7)|\n|Oct 12|\u00a5537k\/t(8)|\u00a5521k\/t(8)|\n|Oct 05|(sparse trades)|(sparse trades)|\n|Sep 28|\u00a5525k\/t(9)|\u00a5509k\/t(8)|\n|...|...|...|\n|Jul 06|\u00a5481k\/t(10)|\u00a5459k\/t(10)|\n|...|...|...|\n|Apr 07|\u00a5494k\/t(6)|\u00a5467k\/t(5)|\n\nYou've probably realised that if there's a 6 week delay, and suppliers had expected demand to kick up again at the start of Feb, then prices should've consolidated mid December, which they didn't.  \nObviously the industry is betting on February softness, and it's not until then that we'll discover if the prediction is accurate.  \nSo I won't be surprised if prices keep easing down for another 6 weeks.\n\nThey're still high. During the April pump depicted on the chart below, spot prices were \\~10% below where they are now.  \nInterestingly, all producers and developers are equal with, or below, their April high, excluding PLS. I had to remove SYA and CXO because they skewed the graph too much, but they follow the same pattern.  \nThat make sense really, because in this game of sentiment, slightly lower rising commodity prices ought to trump higher prices that are easing.\n\n[April peak circled in black](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/skuz5qth2e8a1.jpg?width=1553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59aa2f9d59ded29ff1be6155f9e958d6ca265ab8)\n\nI've only ever found futures useful for one thing: vaguely predicting whether the industry expects prices to rise or fall from current levels.  \n[It's no surprise the're predicting a fall, but not as much as you might think](https:\/\/www.cmegroup.com\/markets\/metals\/battery-metals\/lithium-hydroxide-cif-cjk-fastmarkets.settlements.html) (click link for Nov '24):\n\n[hydroxide futures US$X\\\/kg](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mvd903123e8a1.jpg?width=1254&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f67289eb52835400cd3811de0c2e85eac0315e1)\n\nNote that these are hydroxide futures, not Chinese carbonate spot, so I've done a VAT adjustment to put them on the spot graph below as forecast.  \nI've also added estimates from a number of analysts, many of which still don't really understand the hydroxide\/carbonate dynamic. To keep the table consistent, every estimate is based on their **hydroxide forecasts**. Note that these may change very few months.\n\n[various price estimates by Dec 2024](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jyuul67g3e8a1.jpg?width=1597&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e008af75f9f07de1919afc2c8d4c45c4def20641)\n\nWhy is GS so far from the consensus? It's because they fundamentally differ in their battery manufacturing build out prediction. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, widely accepted as the industry leaders, have a forecast that exceeds GS's by &gt;60% by 2031, even after I add in consumer electronics and other:\n\n[BMI v GS](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o03vtmqj3e8a1.jpg?width=1990&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7451be54798ce0e156703756905a09d6a239c96b)\n\nIf you had access to GS's latest lithium report, you can see they had to adjust their 2022 demand up 15% in a matter of months, from 702kt to 803kt:\n\n[old forecast = top, new = highlighted yellow](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/59800zum3e8a1.jpg?width=760&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a021f6a35138e6bd2c495103f6fd8091de9e61)\n\nDespite that, they've only adjusted their 2023, 2024 &amp; 2025 estimates up by about 5-7%. OK, so they think a recession is happening next year, which might explain the subdued rise over the next 12 months, but why such a plateau on 2024 &amp; 2025? BTW, ESSs are currently growing more YoY compared to EVs in China, so they'll need to redo that forecast at the very least.\n\nAnyway, with the exception of GS, every analyst thinks market rate spodumene will more or less remain above US$2,500\/t through to December 2024. If you want to see how the developers fare at US$3k\/t in 2025, see [this post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ASX_Bets\/comments\/wm9lut\/lithium_cycle_feat_speculative_npats_from_avz_cxo\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\nBased purely on putting numbers in a calculator, some developers still stack up decently at current SPs. But the market shuns calculators, and lithium spot prices decreasing generally means producers &amp; developers will decrease. PLS &amp; AKE should release reports in the next 5 weeks to reassure the market I suppose. But ultimately, a weakening commodity price means they'll be swimming upstream, which is never ideal.\n\nAs for explorers, they should endure pricing weakness well, because at US$2.5k\/t, even digging lithium out of your backyard is nearly profitable.  \nHere's a current explorer table. I don't want to include unproven secondary tenements from RDT, WR1 &amp; LRS, but I know it'll likely lead to queries in the comments if I don't, so I've just gritted my teeth and added them.  \n*Note that due to the amount of warrants PMET has, this table may be slightly unfair as it doesn't reflect the conversion of those warrants into cash balance*.\n\n||**GL1**|\u2190|**ESS**|**GT1**|\u2190|**PMT**|**WR1**|\u2190|**RDT**|\u2190|**LRS**|\u2190|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||Marble Bar|Manna|Pioneer Dome|Seymour|Root|Corvette|Adina|Cancet|Mt Ida|Yinnetharra|Salinas|Catamarca|\n|**MCap AUD F\/D**|$496m|\u2190|$88m|$215m|\u2190|$1.07b|$158m|\u2190|$230m|\u2190|$231m|\u2190|\n|**Approx cash**|$75m|\u2190|$7m|$55m|\u2190|$12m|$17m|\u2190|$65m|\u2190|$25m|\u2190|\n|**Share Price**|$1.835|\u2190|$0.32|$0.78|\u2190|CA$7.63|$0.95|\u2190|$0.46|\u2190|$0.098|\u2190|\n|**Resource (t)**|18.0m|32.7m|11.2m|9.9m|\\-|200m?|\\-|\\-|12.7m|\\-|13.3m|\\-|\n|**Ore Grade**|1.0%|1.0%|1.16%|1.04%|\\-|1.4%?|\\-|\\-|1.20%|\\-|1.20%|\\-|\n|**Lithia (Li2O)**|180,000t|327,000t|129,000t|102,960|\\-|2,800,000?|\\-|\\-|152,400t|\\-|159,600|\\-|\n|**Earliest spod prod**|H2 2025|H2 2025|H2 2025|2026|2027|2027|2026|2026|H1 2025|2026|2026|2027|\n|**Scoping study**|Q1 23|Mar 23|Jan 23|PEA Mar 23|\\-|\\-|\\-|PEA Jun 23|announced|\\-|PEA Mar 23|\\-|\n|**Location**|AUS|\u2190|AUS|CAN|CAN|CAN|CAN|CAN|AUS|AUS|BRA|ARG|\n|**Mining licence**|no|no|no|no|no|no|no|no|yes|no|no|no|\n|**DMS or flotation**|both|both|both|DMS|\\-|DMS|DMS|DMS|both|\\-|DMS|\\-|\n\nI've updated timelines according to GL1's latest interview, which will be relevant for all explorers, and gives a further edge to RDT and their Mt Ida mining licence. Note that RDT just added 120m extra shares to a 380mill float (which are now well underwater), so that'll take time to work through.  \nGT1 breathed some life into their prospects with a potential DMS only operation, and Canadian plays have been pretty popular recently. The govt is reviewing how they can [streamline the 3 year permitting process](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/politics\/critical-minerals-strategy-1.6679728), and they're going to need some pretty quick action on that if they want to throw punches with the AUS explorers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Battery swap stations**\n\nI scoffed when I first heard of battery swap stations, but now I think they could be the future for auto makers. China already has [1900](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MoneybaII_R\/status\/1602132546124681216) of them, and I took a quick look at the economics *within China*.  \nYou save about $13k on a Nio car by opting to rent a battery, and I roughly calculated it'd take 6.5 years before you were out of pocket. But that doesn't factor in access to the latest batteries, or natural degradation in the one you own. It's an interesting prospect for high turnover fleets, albeit out of their price range currently.  \nBut for a person driving obscene amounts of ks and not charging off solar, the return on a rental scheme would be pretty impressive.  \nI'm curious about how it stacks up financially for Nio.  \nI imagine the biggest costs would be asset write-downs, particularly batteries, automatic machinery and solar panels. But the accounting write-down for a solar panel would be heavily mismatched to its potential 50yr life, surely.  \nOn average, they're 100kw in size, which probably generates 400kwh per day in sunny parts of China. So if cars are using a 75kwh battery, you can only service 37 cars per week using solar, and the rest will be *less* profitable as the station is forced to draw from the grid to charge batteries. But they should still be able to manage the station sufficiently to draw during off peak times where possible.\n\nI'd love to see Nio's books, but I'm guessing the path to high profitability in this model is:\n\n* access to cheap solar panels in China\n* high sunshine locations (southern China, Australia, southern Europe...)\n* reduce battery sizes as swap stations make range less critical\n* large metropolitan areas\n* vertical integration\n\nThe last one is key, IMO. You need to be making your own batteries to really maximise your returns, and Nio is doing precisely that from 2024.  \nRegarding point 3, if they bring out a 40kwh battery model they could service 70 vehicles per week on a station. And sure, cheaper models would need cheaper battery rental costs, but the relative profit would be much higher.  \nNio alone aims to control a combined solar capacity (not output, though) of 300MW by 2025, double that of South Australia's battery plant.\n\nDump trucks are firmly in favour of EVs over hydrogen (FCEV), and due to swap stations, I'm changing my mind about long haul trucking, which I now think is a reasonable chance of being the domain of EVs, too.\n\nEdit: finalised spot prices ending 28th Dec","answer":"Love your write ups as always mate.

According to Refinitiv, economists expect 3 million jobs were created, after May\u2019s surprise gain of 2.5 million payrolls beat forecasts by a whopping 10 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf it\u2019s stronger, it will suggest that the improvement is quicker, and that\u2019s kind of what we saw in May with better retail sales, confidence was coming back a little and auto sales were better,\u201d said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets.\n*****\n&gt; The second quarter winds down in the week ahead as investors are hopeful about the recovery but warily eyeing rising cases of Covid-19 in a number of states.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were lower for the week, as markets reacted to rising cases in Texas, Florida and other states. Investors worry about the threat to the economic rebound as those states move to curb some activities. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 16% so far for the second quarter, and it is down nearly 7% for the year. Friday\u2019s losses wiped out the last of the index\u2019s June gains.\n*****\n\u201cI think the stock market is looking beyond the valley. It is expecting a V-shaped economic recovery and a solid 2021 earnings picture,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. He expects large-cap company earnings to be up 30% next year, and small-cap profits to bounce back by 140%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the second half needs to be a \u2018show me\u2019 period, proving that our optimism was justified, and we\u2019ll need to see continued improvement in the economic data, and I think we need to see upward revisions to earnings estimates,\u201d Stovall said.\n*****\n&gt; Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said she expects the recovery will not be as smooth as some expect, particularly considering the resurgence of virus outbreaks in sunbelt states and California.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNow as I watch what\u2019s happening I think it\u2019s more likely to be rolling Ws,\u201d rather than a V, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just predicated on a second wave. I\u2019m not sure we ever exited the first wave.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Even without actual state shutdowns, the virus could slow economic activity. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean businesses won\u2019t shut themselves down, or consumers won\u2019t back down more,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; # Election ahead\n&gt; In the second half of the year, the market should turn its attention to the election, but Sonders does not expect much reaction to it until after Labor Day. RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Democrat Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump by 10 percentage points, and the odds of a Democratic sweep have been rising.\n*****\n&gt; Biden has said he would raise corporate taxes, and some strategists say a sweep would be bad for business, due to increased regulation and higher taxes. Trump is expected to continue using tariffs, which unsettles the market, though both candidates are expected to take a tough stance on China.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf it looks like the Senate stays Republican than there\u2019s less to worry about in terms of policy changes,\u201d Sonders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever as binary as some people think.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said a quick study shows that in the four presidential election years back to 1960, where the first quarter was negative, and the second quarter positive, stocks made gains in the second half.\n*****\n&gt; Those were 1960 when John Kennedy took office, 1968, when Richard Nixon won; 1980 when Ronald Reagan\u2019s was elected to his first term; and 1992, the first win by Bill Clinton. Coincidentally, in all of those years, the opposing party gained control of the White House.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus\n&gt; The stocks market\u2019s strong second-quarter showing came after the Fed and Congress moved quickly to inject the economy with trillions in stimulus. That unlocked credit markets and triggered a stampede by companies to restructure or issue debt. About $2 trillion in fiscal spending was aimed at consumers and businesses, who were in sudden need of cash after the abrupt shutdown of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both testify before the House Financial Services Committee Tuesday on the response to the virus. That will be important as markets look ahead to another fiscal package from Congress this summer, which is expected to provide aid to states and local governments; extend some enhanced benefits for unemployment, and provide more support for businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSo much of it is still so fluid. There are a bunch of fiscal items that are rolling off. There\u2019s talk about another fiscal stimulus payment like they did last time with a $1,200 check,\u201d said Cummins.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to bicker about the size and content of the stimulus package but ultimately come to an agreement before enhanced unemployment benefits run out at the end of July. Cummins said state budgets begin a new year July 1, and states with a critical need for funds may have to start letting workers go, as they cut expenses.\n*****\n&gt; The Trump administration has indicated the jobs report Thursday could help shape the fiscal package, depending on what it shows. The federal supplement to state unemployment benefits has been $600 a week, but there is opposition to extending that, and strategists expect it to be at least cut in half.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 12.2% from 13.3% in May. Cummins said he had expected 7.2 million jobs, well above the consensus, and an unemployment rate of 11.8%.\n*****\n&gt; As of last week, nearly 20 million people were collecting state unemployment benefits, and millions more were collecting under a federal pandemic aid program.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe magnitude here and whether it\u2019s 3 million or 7 million is kind of hard to handicap to begin with,\u201d Cummins said. Economists have preferred to look at unemployment claims as a better real time read of employment, but they now say those numbers could be impacted by slow reporting or double filing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity on how you define the unemployed in the Covid 19 environment,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. \u201cIf there\u2019s 30 million people receiving insurance, unemployment should be above 20%.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/h30byeH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gmaTq9q.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lwXal2a.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NF3zXpe.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GxlZmlt.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bCFRgYl.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback\/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bcysKx4.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fVhp6Ao.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Qdshdj1g\/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Fzq57jSf\/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/QNwWLCYC\/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Bbr827PH\/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# When Will The Economy Recover?\n\n&gt; The economy is moving in the right direction, as many economic data points are coming in substantially better than what the economists expected. From May job gains coming in more than 10 million higher than expected and retail sales soaring a record 18%, how quickly the economy is bouncing back has surprised nearly everyone.\n\n&gt; \u201cAs good as the recent economic data has been, we want to make it clear, it could still take years for the economy to fully come back,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThink of it like building a house. You get all the big stuff done early, then some of the small things take so much longer to finish; I\u2019m looking at you crown molding.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the hard truth; it might take years for all of the jobs that were lost to fully recover. In fact, during the 10 recessions since 1950, it took an average of 30 months for lost jobs to finally come back. As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, recoveries have taken much longer lately. In fact, it took four years for the jobs lost during the tech bubble recession of the early 2000s to come back and more than six years for all the jobs lost to come back after the Great Recession. Given many more jobs were lost during this recession, it could takes many years before all of them indeed come back.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/lplresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/6.26.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The economy is going the right direction, and if there is no major second wave outbreak it could surprise to the upside. Importantly, this economic recovery will still be a long and bumpy road.\n\n*****\n\n# Nasdaq - Russell Spread Pulling the Rubber Band Tight\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq has been outperforming every other US-based equity index over the last year, and nowhere has the disparity been wider than with small caps. The chart below compares the performance of the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 over the last 12 months. While the performance disparity is wide now, through last summer, the two indices were tracking each other nearly step for step. Then last fall, the Nasdaq started to steadily pull ahead before really separating itself in the bounce off the March lows. Just to illustrate how wide the gap between the two indices has become, over the last six months, the Nasdaq is up 11.9% compared to a decline of 15.8% for the Russell 2000. That's wide!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2020\/06\/062620-Nasdaq-vs-Russell1.png))**\n\n&gt; In order to put the recent performance disparity between the two indices into perspective, the chart below shows the rolling six-month performance spread between the two indices going back to 1980. With a current spread of 27.7 percentage points, the gap between the two indices hasn't been this wide since the days of the dot-com boom. Back in February 2000, the spread between the two indices widened out to more than 50 percentage points. Not only was that period extreme, but ten months before that extreme reading, the spread also widened out to more than 51 percentage points. The current spread is wide, but with two separate periods in 1999 and 2000 where the performance gap between the two indices was nearly double the current level, that was a period where the Nasdaq REALLY outperformed small caps.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2020\/06\/062620-Nasdaq-vs-Russell-Performance-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate the magnitude of the Nasdaq's outperformance over the Russell 2000 from late 1998 through early 2000, the chart below shows the performance of the two indices beginning in October 1998. From that point right on through March of 2000 when the Nasdaq peaked, the Nasdaq rallied more than 200% compared to the Russell 2000 which was up a relatively meager 64%. In any other environment, a 64% gain in less than a year and a half would be excellent, but when it was under the shadow of the surging Nasdaq, it seemed like a pittance.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2020\/06\/062620-Russell-1998-2000.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Share Price Performance\n\n&gt; The US equity market made its most recent peak on June 8th. From the March 23rd low through June 8th, the average stock in the large-cap Russell 1,000 was up more than 65%! Since June 8th, the average stock in the index is down more than 11%. Below we have broken the index into deciles (10 groups of 100 stocks each) based on simple share price as of June 8th. Decile 1 (marked \"Highest\" in the chart) contains the 10% of stocks with the highest share prices. Decile 10 (marked \"Lowest\" in the chart) contains the 10% of stocks with the lowest share prices. As shown, the highest priced decile of stocks are down an average of just 4.8% since June 8th, while the lowest priced decile of stocks are down an average of 21.5%. It's pretty remarkable how performance gets weaker and weaker the lower the share price gets.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2020\/06\/shareprices.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Nasdaq 2% Pullbacks From Record Highs\n\n&gt; It's hard to believe that sentiment can change so fast in the market that one day investors and traders are bidding up stocks to record highs, but then the next day sell them so much that it takes the market down over 2%. That's exactly what happened not only in the last two days but also two weeks ago. While the 5% pullback from a record high back on June 10th took the Nasdaq back below its February high, this time around, the Nasdaq has been able to hold above those February highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2020\/06\/062520-Nasdaq.png))**\n\n&gt; In the entire history of the Nasdaq, there have only been 12 periods prior to this week where the Nasdaq closed at an all-time high on one day but dropped more than 2% the next day. Those occurrences are highlighted in the table below along with the index's performance over the following week, month, three months, six months, and one year. We have also highlighted each occurrence that followed a prior one by less than three months in gray. What immediately stands out in the table is how much gray shading there is. In other words, these types of events tend to happen in bunches, and if you count the original occurrence in each of the bunches, the only two occurrences that didn't come within three months of another occurrence (either before or after) were July 1986 and May 2017.\n\n&gt; In terms of market performance following prior occurrences, the Nasdaq's average and median returns were generally below average, but there is a pretty big caveat. While the average one-year performance was a gain of 1.0% and a decline of 23.6% on a median basis, the six occurrences that came between December 1999 and March 2000 all essentially cover the same period (which was very bad) and skew the results. Likewise, the three occurrences in the two-month stretch from late November 1998 through January 1999 where the Nasdaq saw strong gains also involves a degree of double-counting. As a result of these performances at either end of the extreme, it's hard to draw any trends from the prior occurrences except to say that they are typically followed by big moves in either direction. The only time the Nasdaq wasn't either 20% higher or lower one year later was in 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2020\/06\/062520-Nasdaq-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Christmas in July: NASDAQ\u2019s Mid-Year Rally\n\n&gt; In the mid-1980s the market began to evolve into a tech-driven market and the market\u2019s focus in early summer shifted to the outlook for second quarter earnings of technology companies. Over the last three trading days of June and the first nine trading days in July, NASDAQ typically enjoys a rally. This 12-day run has been up 27 of the past 35 years with an average historical gain of 2.5%. This year the rally may have begun a day early, today and could last until on or around July 14.\n\n&gt; After the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000, NASDAQ\u2019s mid-year rally had a spotty track record from 2002 until 2009 with three appearances and five no-shows in those years. However, it has been quite solid over the last ten years, up nine times with a single mild 0.1% loss in 2015. Last year, NASDAQ advanced a solid 4.6% during the 12-day span.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/66.media.tumblr.com\/9a3f9a9bcdec2658e277e355b7546afd\/cc4a84325aa4bac2-f4\/s500x750\/7fb3b7511a3babffaf166b95698ee3d26b9fce6e.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Tech Historically Leads Market Higher Until Q3 of Election Years\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close DJIA was down 8.8% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was down 3.5% and NASDAQ was up 12.1%. Compared to the typical election year, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 are below historical average performance while NASDAQ is above average. However this year has not been a typical election year. Due to the covid-19, the market suffered the damage of the shortest bear market on record and a new bull market all before the first half of the year has come to an end.\n\n&gt; In the surrounding Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday\u2019s close) to All Years and Election Years. This year\u2019s performance has been plotted on the right vertical axis in each chart. This year certainly has been unlike any other however some notable observations can be made. For DJIA and S&amp;P 500, January, February and approximately half of March have historically been weak, on average, in election years. This year the bear market ended on March 23. Following those past weak starts, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 historically enjoyed strength lasting into September before experiencing any significant pullback followed by a nice yearend rally. NASDAQ\u2019s election year pattern differs somewhat with six fewer years of data, but it does hint to a possible late Q3 peak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/66.media.tumblr.com\/9a56ad0dccb7029a9152a881572424d1\/9349f852f8a4f51b-62\/s500x750\/fc4b4fc52d43524b6d2e5f24afe1a490d20e2846.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/66.media.tumblr.com\/5532ba3299f602fd188596114aed571c\/9349f852f8a4f51b-91\/s500x750\/9c9f9c3f4b1e6be51e2e1bdba2a7cd66624a796b.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/66.media.tumblr.com\/b65eca042c2a1b99b072d84852a9ec79\/9349f852f8a4f51b-9a\/s500x750\/b3bc6f76675d40182131deb2406e2f7ca1692f78.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending June 26th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_iVb1NaoMv4)**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 6.28.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cNZKFf-m6eo))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$CPRI** \n&gt; * **$XYF** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$MEI** \n&gt; * **$UNF** \n&gt; * **$CDMO** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$CULP** \n&gt; * **$XELA** \n&gt; * **$KFY** \n&gt; * **$RTIX** \n&gt; * **$JRSH**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/3NK1JK2q\/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/HnB2rf2k\/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XH4RkL4.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date\/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.29.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uKFekV6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.30.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6OL1zNs.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/yrOF8X0.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/X6CIUQJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.2.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2dhu21m.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.3.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.3.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $48.49\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

I am new on this sub so I assume that this kind of post has already been deployed on this sub numerous times, so sorry about that. \n\nBasically, I am 25 years old, I have a good paying job and I live in Croatia. For the last month and a half I've gotten REALLY interested in financing and economics and I've been reading about all these ways you can invest - stocks, bonds, funds, etc. I am looking for a way to invest my money, at least a little bit, into some of these, especially in these ETF funds. The problem is I still don't know a lot about this stuff and I am in the process of learning. This post and your answers down below will surely contribute to my learning process and that is why I'm posting this here so thank you in advance!\n\nSo, these are my basic questions:\n\n1. How does an ETF fund work and what types of ETF funds exist?\n2. What is the best way to invest in these funds if I am considering investing lower amounts of money (for example, 100\u20ac, so nothing big)?\n\nP. S. I am mainly looking into investing LONG-TERM (10, 20, 30 years), HOWEVER, if there is some way to earn a little bit of money SHORT-TERM, I will gladly listen out! But LONG TERM is my goal! I just wanted to point it out.\n\nAnother P. S. We are trainsitioning to EUROS in Croatia in about a year or two (we currently have CROATIAN KUNA), don't know if that will affect your answers and advices, but just so you know.\n\nThank you so much!","answer":"1. An ETF (exchange traded fund) is somewhat like a basket of different things like indexes, stocks from a certain sector, commodities (gold, silver). These ETFs trade like individual stocks, which means you can buy and sell these ETFs like it\u2019s an individual stock. What important to consider is, are the expense ratios. These are costs that will be subtracted from your positions during the year, because of management fees for example. The lower these expense ratios, the better.\n2. For long term, ETFs like VWRL\/VWCE or VUSA\/IUSA\/VUAA are good. VWRL\/VWCE tracks about 3800 companies over the whole world (large and mid caps, small cap excluded), expense ratio 0.22%. VWRL is the distributing one (dividends paid out), while VWCE reinvests the dividends. VUSA\/IUSA tracks the S&amp;P 500 which consists of the biggest US companies and is distributing the dividends. VUAA reinvests the dividends, expense ratio is 0.07%."}

My question is, should I keep my money in the market, or pull a chunk out so I can pad my checking account for child expenses. I don\u2019t keep much in my BOA account right now as my bills are relatively low and I like seeing my money grow. The only splurge I\u2019ve made with my life insurance money was building Heather\u2019s dream kitchen which I look at as an investment. Any advice will would be appreciated.","answer":"I would wait till you cross that bridge. So sell your assets for kids you don't have.  You may find that conceiving might be difficult or not possible.  At which point you may decide to either try IVF which in itself a huge expense on top of the kid(s) if you're successful."}

Over the past couple years I have been reading posts on here and they have helped me tremendously and I while i am not yet FI  I wanted to tell my story. When I was 16 I got caught up in gangs and selling drugs. I was homeless and living in my car by 18. I became addicted to heroin. I was in and out of rehabs and hospitals from OD's and suicide attempts. This went on until I was 25 and I decided to make a change, I left the city I lived in and went to a small town 100 miles away with a duffel bag of clothes and about 60$ in my pocket. I lived in my car and worked a shit min. wage job for 3 years slowly saving money living in shelters and got an apt. I clawed my way up to a management position and got some experience which landed me a real job. I now have a beautiful wife, retirement account.

Lots of people may want to sell around a psychologically significant round number, so this gives them a chance to do so just below, and thus reduce the likelihood that we will see drops after we cross the 1k threshold.

{"question":"Rocket Companies (RKT) - DD on an Undervalued Gem! This is my first DD post on any company, be gentle.\n\nDisclaimer: I am long RKT. This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post. I\u2019m not a professional, I\u2019m not even an amateur, this is a Wendy\u2019s.\n\n**Sources used:** RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary**\n\nRocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.\n\n* RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future\n* RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX\/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.\n* The RKT \u201cecosystem\u201d provides a \u201cfull cycle\u201d solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it\u2019s an app, it\u2019s online, it\u2019s doable from home and it\u2019s not complicated. There\u2019s an inherent advantage in what they\u2019re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that\u2019s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there\u2019s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.\n* RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.\n* RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).\n* RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they\u2019re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That\u2019s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.\n* RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That\u2019s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P\/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.\n\n**Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company**\n\nThe average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share.\n\nThis estimate gives a ttm P\/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, *even compared to the financial\/mortgage sector*. What\u2019s key here is, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P\/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P\/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P\/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P\/E ratio lookups.\n\nLet\u2019s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. **That would put its fair value** ***right now*** **at $57.75 per share.** I think it\u2019s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it\u2019s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it.\n\n**Key Point - Catalysts**\n\nThis thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I\u2019m buying shares, I\u2019m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2\/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don\u2019t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.\n\nSupporting information and background follows.\n\n**The Business**\n\nRKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:\n\n*Home Financing*\n\n* Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent \u201cpublic facing\u201d part of the Rocket ecosystem.\n* Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as \u201csupporting infrastructure\u201d to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop.\n* Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The \u201cbusiness end\u201d in my simple understanding of the world.\n* Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.\n* Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada\n* Edison Financial - Basically the \u201cfront end\u201d of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.\n\n*Home Sale and Search*\n\n* Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying\/selling\/financing.\n* For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it\u2019s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.\n\n*Auto &amp; Personal Financing*\n\n* Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.\n* Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.\n\n*Media*\n\n* Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.\n* Lower My Bills - this company is basically a \u201cportal\u201d business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.\n\n*Services &amp; Technology Development*\n\n* Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.\n* Rock Central - I will generalize this as \u201cbusiness support\u201d. HR, administration, etc.\n* Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.\n\n**Recent Acquisitions**\n\nRKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 ([https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce\\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce\\_referrer\\_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA\\_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT\\_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv)) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they\u2019re the ones leading that charge.\n\n**Management**\n\nI do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune\u2019s \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For\u201d list for 17 consecutive years.\n\n**Financials and Growth**\n\nWhen it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don\u2019t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here\u2019s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:\n\n$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth.\n\nFrom that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected.\n\nNet income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.\n\nClosed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.\n\nNet rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).\n\nRKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with **$3.5B cash on hand**. That\u2019s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.\n\nRKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.\n\nQuick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They\u2019ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don\u2019t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.\n\nOk so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I\u2019m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It\u2019s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:\n\n[https:\/\/finbox.com\/NYSE:RKT\/models\/dcf-growth-exit-5yr](https:\/\/finbox.com\/NYSE:RKT\/models\/dcf-growth-exit-5yr)\n\n**I don\u2019t believe that fair value estimate for an instant**, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it\u2019s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.\n\n**Product Channels**\n\nRKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don\u2019t lie:\n\n* Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)\n* Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)\n   * Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)\n\nThe partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.\n\n**Current Market and outlook**\n\nRight now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% ([https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/02\/03\/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/02\/03\/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html))\n\nI cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.\n\nHere\u2019s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.\n\n**Positions**: RKT shares. Cost basis of $21.14.","answer":"It's a company that's been trading sideways for over a year. It's a thetaganger wet dream, especially if the bull sentiment catches on. I hadn't considered it, but I'll probably start selling CSPs this week. Thanks for the detailed DD."}

I recently sold a small apartment and now have 60,000\u20ac sitting in my bank account.  At this point, I really understand the German real-estate market works and part of me want to continue investing in what I know. but on the other hand, I already own the apartment that I live in and it seems wiser not to put everything in real-estate.

{"question":"Is CuriosityStream (streaming platform) grossly undervalued at $550M with already 13M paying subscribers? The streaming industry is getting a lot of exposure lately with all the news from Disney+ and HBO max. Looking for a pure play in the streaming service I came across CuriosityStream. Basically the platform offers documentaries about science, history, politics, etc...  and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform. The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former chairman of Discovery.\n\nAfter digging a little bit I was surprised to see that despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3 was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber base comes from bundled packages at a heavy discount. They are looking for exposure while growing at all costs. Here are some key point:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The company has no debt and $180M cash in the balance sheet.\n* **The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions  in Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020**\n* Over 60% gross margin\n* They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in revenues\n\nGiving the uncertainty of the current market environment it seems pretty safe to buy something that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting an industry, targeting a more sophisticated  customers instead of the average becky who likes stranger things. The last time John Hendricks created something (Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a $32B company before stepping down and creating CuriosityStream.\n\nI would like to hear your thoughts on the comment section and discuss if in fact CuriosityStream is already fairly valued, undervalued or maybe overvalued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Side note:*** John Hendricks has been buying shares this month increasing his position by 21%.","answer":"&gt; After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3 was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are getting\n\nI would take a look to see if they just gave out a ton of free subscriptions and that is how they went from 2M to 13M.

{"question":"PSA: Call options can &amp; are being used to create un-squeezable short positions Know a lot of you are eagerly awaiting the short interest report at 6PM, so here's a quick read in the meantime. Whatever the number is, I'm actually inclined to agree with the AMC\/GME bulls that it'll continue to be high, and even significantly understate the number of actual bearish positions (including the synthetic ones). Unfortunately, I also don't really think it matters in the mid-run.\n\nRemember back when GME was squeezing to the max, and people noticed massive blocks of 800c's being purchased and took it as a bullish flag from institutional interest? I'm rather certain these were purchased by incoming short sellers, and here's why:\n\n1. Let's say an institution is short 100 shares today, believing GME will drop from 50 to 30 by end of month\n2. They then buy a GME 2\/26 100C for $3.38, which might seem bizarre given their belief in the stock going down\n3. But using this setup, they're 100% protected if GME temporarily skyrockets to 1000, so long as they leave enough collateral\/liquidity to cover the delta between 50 and 100 in between. They never plan to execise the option, but leave it in place to prevent a margin call\n4. If they're right, they pocket the $20 less $3.38 for the call option less interest expense per share\n\nCall options enable you to build a hedged short position that's impossible to squeeze. You might ask why Melvin didn't do this to begin with - this is where the element of surprise in a short squeeze is really important. Year long hedges for a super rare occurrence will completely suck out your alpha, and by the time Melvin picked up on this, call options were ridiculously expensive and they were out of capital and time. If you know something's coming and the insurance is cheap, you'll definitely buy it.\n\nI think the short interest % will continue to climb even if the price stays stable and IV goes down, as these hedges will get cheaper and cheaper to purchase. I'm sure this will be very basic to a lot of you, but figured it might be informative to the influx of Reddit new joiners in the last few weeks.\n\ntl;dr element of surprise really important in squeezing the institutions out, and the dropping IV of late is your enemy if you wanted the squeeze to happen. I'm not recommending the position above as I don't think it's worth touching this meme overall given the multitude of other opportunities out there\n\nEdit: For all the people smartly pointing out that this is just a normal hedge, you're right. But it's also a hedge that ironically kills the need to hedge, like flood insurance that prevents raining. So the flood insurance might be boring to you, but some of you might be missing that nuance. ","answer":"Eh, sort of. Yes, it would hedge the HF's risk, but the risk is now translated to the MM short the call. If the hedge fund is short the stock and holds the call, the MMs still need to locate the stock for delivery for the HF to cover. If the stock is illiquid, they run into the same problem\n\nBut, the trick is that they can strategically fail to deliver here and their failure-to-deliver clock will be reset. They now have 21 more days to play the same stupid game"}

{"question":"When does a market become \u2018monopolistically competitive \u2019 vs an oligopoly? I guess I\u2019m theory and practice- like in theory economic profits would be eaten in the long run for the former, but that\u2019s not something we can directly observe right?","answer":"Other comments here are confusing game theoretic oligopoly models with the general meaning of an oligopoly market structure. Oligopoly predates concepts of game theory by about 60 years.  \n\nThe only difference is whether there is free entry or not. Oligopoly has barriers to entry, so firms can earn long run profits. Monopolistic competition assumes free entry, so while firms charge above marginal cost, profits are driven down to zero. \n\nThe monopolistic competition model was first developed by Chamberlain using a representative consumer, but it\u2019s not widely used. \n\nThe cournot model was one of the early oligopoly models, but can be transformed into a monopolistic competition model by simply relaxing the assumption of a fixed number of firms."}

{"question":"Bitcoin energy usage IS a problem, and the crypto space would only benefit if everyone admitted that. Let's be real, a lot of people here think bitcoin's energy consumption is not a problem, or it's just green people envious that they didn't make money.\n\nThe top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on Twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. \n\nI'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are \"features\" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.  \n\n\"but defi is the future, we don't need banks\". You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo\/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin.

Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional. \n\nCrypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting \"I'm the king\". \n\nTL;DR: bitcoin's PoW is a cow infinitely farting, there shouldn't be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes.","answer":"I don't understand why people keep comparing energy usage of BTC to other things.

This past weekend he passed away in a tragic climbing accident (at the age of 35). I may not have the right words right now but I wanted to try and express my appreciation for this community. My partner has always been a dreamer, and GameStop gave him something big to dream about. He suffered from a very difficult bout of depression last year and it was this community that gave him something to truly hold onto. We would spend our nights watching videos about our dream houses, and we often fantasized about all of the adventures we wanted to go on in the future. He talked to me about his hopes that all of us apes could change the world together, he wanted to do so much good. \n\nMy partner wanted to build low income housing communities where people struggling financially like us could get their bearings. He also fully and excitedly supported my dream of having an animal sanctuary. Most recently, he was brainstorming about a online community where people could find information about every politician and person in power worldwide, and who was financially backing them. He wanted to create a space where true transparency would be possible. \n\nI wanted to share some of him with all of you because he loved this community so much, and you gave us both something to look forward to in this life. He had all of our shares (our savings) directly registered under his name so I may never have access to them, but at least they may live forever in the infinity pool. \n\nMy partner had a difficult time in life but he never ever let that dim his dreams or his love of life and adventure. He was pure and true and genuine and only wanted great things for this world. He often wore his GameStop hoodie and tshirt proudly, and he would walk around absolutely beaming. He also used his GameStop beer glass I had made for every celebratory beer he had. This weekend I will be repping GameStop in his shirt at his memorial. \n\nHe was filled with so much passion and magic, and his smile was the most contagious one I have ever seen.

I hope some of his spirit inspires you all.\n\n*edit*\n\nWow. I\u2019m at a loss for words (genuinely). You all have me crying and laughing and appreciating this community so much.

{"question":"Why you should never try ANL This keeps coming up so I thought I would write a quick primer for it. \n\nMany, many people come across a stock trading at $0.001 that occasionally pips up to $0.002 for a 100% gain. For an example of this we will use ANL. \n\nThen the smooth brain thinks to themselves, why if I just buy in at $0.001 and sell only a **single** pip higher, I can double my money! Obviously I am a genius and nobody else has ever thought of this! \n\nOf they go to buy their parcel at $0.001 and perform the infinite tendies hack. \n\nOf course, if infinite tendies hacks existed, wet behind the ears retail traders wouldn't be the ones discovering them. Let's start with the market depth for ANL. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lq8ou9ura0681.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d4f9dcb28df9c42073370ed73a7cd11f8dfc6f7\n\nOk let's look at the buy side. There are 3.3 billion units waiting in the queue at the magical $0.001 price. That means if you want to buy in, you need to wait until all those orders get filled before you can buy in. No worries, you think, how long could that possibly take?\n\nLet's take a gander at the trading history\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w159t0jdb0681.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28a0790e39ae490ffeac1c9b3fbc9aa37b7d0f8f\n\nNow it does fluctuate a fair bit, from single digit millions up to low 3 digit millions, but whatever way you slice it, you are waiting a LOOONG time for the $0.001 buy in. Definitely months. \n\nOk ok, but now you have your precious $0.001 shares, time to quickly flip them for double your money right? Wrong. Now you have to deal with the other side of the equation. 600 million units ahead of you in the sell queue. Well at least it's not 3.3B right? Well in the buy example I generously assigned all of the volume to $0.001 trades. That might be close to true, but it's almost certainly not true for the $0.002 trade. In fact I would expect them to make up a fraction of the trading volume. \n\nLet's take a look at volume by price (for the last month to avoid whatever outlier pump took it briefly to $0.004)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5uaks2umc0681.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3124078bed9fc3f13b525e6c0a958237ae73f594\n\nSo the big red bar at the bottom is $0.001, the one about half the size in the middle is $0.0015 (which won't be available to you) and the tiny little green stub at the top is $0.002. Let's chuck out the middle one for the sake of simplicity.  A bit of rough measuring gives me about 4% of trades being for the magical $0.002 \"double your money\" amount and the other 96% of trades being for $0.001. \n\nOk so if we normalise the two sides so that we can see what the effective number of units we'd have to get through if we assumed the entire day's volume went to that trade we get\n\n3.3B \/ 0.96 = 3.4B  \n600m \/ 0.04 = 15B \n\nSo assuming a consistent trading pattern, it would take 5 times as long to sell at $0.002 than to buy at $0.001 if you joined the queue today. You could be waiting a year\n\nOK ok, let's step back from the market depth for a minute. What about the actual company? \n\nWith a STAGGERING 21B shares on issue, at $0.001 SP, the company is valued at $21m MC. For your SP to double so you can double your money, the market cap has to double also. So a single pip moves the market cap by $20m dollars! This is why it is so hard to sell at $0.002, it means that the company goes from a $20m valuation to a $40m valuation. Having such a huge hurdle to overcome is why this stock consistently trades at this price and rarely gets any traction before returning to it. \n\nI hope you can see now that trying to pull this off is a very bad idea and you would be better off putting it into a stock with some actual liquidity. \n\nFin.","answer":"Great post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom memory, u\/THESUICIDALCACTUS has traded **ANL** successfully, and our own '*the people's mod'* u\/mcfucking used them as his weapon of choice during a purge?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould be wrong about that second one..."}

{"question":"Wells Fargo Using Incredibly Inexperienced Mortgage Loan Consultants I'm currently in the process of financing the purchase of a home through Wells Fargo. After a few phone conversations with my mortgage loan consultant, who is tasked with walking me through the entire process, I began to suspect that he wasn't really experienced in this arena when I corrected him on interest rate terms a couple times. When I received a loan estimate summary, I noticed there were several lines that were questionable so I took a screenshot and sent it to him. He responded back and thanked me for bringing this to his attention and said that he would \"escalate it to his internal team.\" After this, I began to snoop.\n\nI found his LinkedIn page and it looks like he has a bachelor's in marketing and this seems to be his first real job post-college. Not knocking a marketing degree but it is definitely unrelated to the mortgage process. He's a nice guy and all, and I'm in finance so I'm confident in my ability to catch errors and oversights, but I'm getting a little nervous that something could slip through the cracks and end up throwing a wrench in the process.\n\nAnyone have a similar experience working with Wells Fargo or other banks on a mortgage and receiving someone with questionable qualifications?

{"question":"The Total Return Swap: How Popcorn is used exactly as a Swap with GME, and its implications. Warning: The following post is **speculation** on how a swap is being used against GME.\n\n**TL;DR: I am attempting to explain how popcorn is being used as a SWAP with GME. More specifically, popcorn is possibly being used as collateral for a short position of GME held by a third party who actually owns the short positions, and the hedgies are profiting\/losing daily based on the performance of the swap. Why is this important? Understanding the process provides us a way to gauge how much we are winning the war against GME shorters through TA. In addition, and completely unrelated to GME apes, this has DIRE implications for popcorn holders.**\n\nIn the past, there have been a few great DD posts that talked about swaps, popcorn, and Berkshire. Here is one of the first DD that got me asking questions, [THE POPCORN \/ BUFFETT HEDGE: A Weapon of Financial Mass Destruction](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/uhs0x1\/the_popcorn_buffett_hedge_a_weapon_of_financial\/) by u\/Digitlnoize\n\nAlso the recent swap post on Twitter by ShillWhisperer: [https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShillWhisperer\/status\/1530623185229586432](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShillWhisperer\/status\/1530623185229586432)\n\nIt sounded good, but I wanted to know exactly HOW the swap worked and how popcorn was being used. So I started digging.\n\n# What exactly is a swap, and how is it being used against GME?\n\nThere are actually [several kinds of swaps, per Investopia](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/investing\/052915\/different-types-swaps.asp), and they all work slightly differently and serve different purposes.\n\n**Credit Default Swap**: The ones made famous from the 2008 crash involving the housing market\/bonds made famous from the Big Short movie are 'Credit Default Swaps.' These act as buying insurance on an asset that you don't own. Every month you pay a fee, and if that asset blows up, you get paid even though you didn't own the underlying.\n\n**Commodity Swap**: The ones that veggie growers and other physical goods traders use to hedge against volatility and uncertainty are 'Commodity Swaps.' I think this is what a lot of apes may think how popcorn is being used, as a \"hedge\" against GME, that if GME goes up, hedgie losses are offset by the gains of popcorn because they have swapped losses\/profits between the two with another party. I personally don't believe this is what is being used against GME.\n\n**Total Return Swap**: **Lastly, the one that makes the most sense to me and if there is a swap in my opinion it can only really be this swap, is the Total Return Swap (TRS).** In this swap, one party Hedgie A, can take on a short or long position on an asset without ever shorting or holding the underlying. They go to Bank A (or possibly Broker, or maybe a Family Fund?) to do the actual shorting, but Hedgie A pays them a daily fee (low risk) to receive all the benefits or losses of the position. So if there is a profit in the position, Hedgie A receives a paycheck from the entity holding the position, which would be Bank A. If there is a loss on the position, Hedgie A then writes a check to Bank A. In order to hold this long\/short position, Hedgie A must provide collateral, and that is where popcorn comes in.\n\n**Why would they use a total return swap to short instead of just directly shorting?**\n\nAs I understand it, the advantage of a TRS that they can get leverage, and also keep the shorts hidden, because swaps are unreported (a private contract between parties).\n\nAlso, be aware that the Total Return Swap is what Bill Hwang used to hide his long positions. [Here is a great video on YouTube explaining the entire process and how Hwang did it.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JfPtabPipaQ)\n\nNow, I can't confirm 100% that this is what hedgies are doing to short GameStop, but I have a few other data points to back up this suspicion.\n\n## Summary of what I think is happening\n\n1. Hedgie A wants to short GME, but wants leverage, and to hide the short position. Decides to use a TRS.\n2. Hedgie A calls up Bank A, to get Bank A to hold a short position on GME\n3. Hedgie A pays a daily\/monthly fee to Bank A to keep the position open\n4. Bank A pays Hedgie A daily\/monthly **profit** if the short position is net positive\n5. Hedgie A pays Bank A a daily\/monthy **loss** if the short position is net negative\n6. Hedgie A must post collateral to Bank A to keep the short position open\n7. The collateral that Hedgie A uses is popcorn (and\/or additional assets)\n\n# Hedgies Loading the Ammo\n\nIn order for the TRS to work, whatever collateral hedgies are using must have value. They must be long on this collateral. As such, there must have been an accumulation period, and they must pump this collateral afterwards.\n\nLet's look at popcorn:\n\nWell, well, well, what have we here. Popcorn did a 480% increase from May 21 to June 2\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zf855jltw5491.png?width=1341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b95291f1ccd77fe78b785310a0008c540cf187eb\n\nAnd then as for GME:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/frgx5upuw5491.png?width=1341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d4aecd85c087fa83927cd52ede1ce9442459e63\n\nGME had a whopping...62% gain from May 21 to June 2?\n\nNote that at this time, June 2, 2021 (the highest candle of popcorn), popcorn overtook GME's marketcap for the first time: $31bn to $20bn. It was after this point that GME seemed to have been under hedgie control for a good part of the next year.\n\nAnother odd thing I noticed was that popcorn always had massive amounts of volume compared to GME. They ALWAYS had a larger daily moneyflow, of share price x traded shares. It always seemed to me that GME had more apes buying than popcorn did. Just look at the difference in activities in the subs, and userbase. Why, then, did popcorn have such large volumes every day? And then it occurred to me to look at another data point.\n\nHere is popcorn's institutional ownership over 2021 to present via Marketbeat.com\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/a9x1c4gww5491.png?width=1942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=695167a66e0c82810d8245b3277928f7687f396c\n\nThis image explains all of the oddities surrounding popcorn. Why there was so much buying despite lack of retail interest (comparatively to GME), and how the price jumped so significantly while GME barely popped (comparatively).\n\nMy hypothesis is that, while not every institution is short GME and has to pump popcorn for collateral, it's highly possible that Kenny &amp; Friends prepped some popcorn-flavored kool-aid and passed it around to their friends. Gave them tips, and got them to help bag-hold under the guise of profiting off the next big meme squeeze. This helps the short position hedgies maintain collateral, and thus maintain or increase their short positions on GME in the swap.\n\nLast year, I had run into a Yahoo article that commented on Ken and Citadel's LONG position on popcorn via public holdings. I can't link it, because it has the popcorn name in url and I get removed by automod. But it notes that:\n\n*When looking at the institutional investors followed by Insider Monkey, Citadel Investment Group, managed by Ken Griffin, holds the most valuable position in POPCORN Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:POPCORN).*\n\nI posted this article on the popcorn sub asking why they hate Kenny G when their main man is actually net long on popcorn. I got swiftly banned.\n\nBy the way, here is GME's institutional ownership over 2021 to present\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xyhxoxgxw5491.png?width=1942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ea899946f49f3874788f7dc712075956b4dd0bf\n\nSo far, we have proof that institutions have been quite long and bullish on popcorn (and are actually quite bearish on GME). The TA shows that there was a large period of accumulation, and after marketcaps flipped, GME seemed quite suppressed. These actions, while not directly proving, do show popcorn possibly being used as collateral for GME's shorts in a Total Return Swap. But don't worry, the redemption arc is coming, and you're gonna like how the story seems like it wants to end.\n\n# TA on popcorn and GME predicting the tides of the war?\n\nIf we look at the chart of popcorn, although it goes up with GME goes up and down when GME goes down, we can see several things.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ln26wlxyw5491.png?width=2696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f1b516894a01b29b107ae642f559cf2b903053\n\n1. Popcorn is actually making lower lows\n2. It has fallen out of its bullish dorito chip\n3. It is spiraling towards the bottom of a descending channel.\n\nWhat this means, is that more folks are selling than buying popcorn.\n\nLet's compare to GME's chart\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x92to7wzw5491.png?width=2696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b4f48bf6028aaf2aba85c13930d9f8f84d11f5b\n\nOver the long term, we can see\n\n1. GME is actually making higher lows\n2. It has risen BACK into its bullish dorito chip\n3. It is propelling towards the resistance (high\/ceiling) of a similar descending channel\n\nThis is showing that over long term, GME wants to go to Uranus.\n\n**So what does this have to do with swaps?** If you look at the two images, you can see that the most recent dates, GME had a higher low while popcorn had a lower low. And more importantly, that's exactly around the time when GME had the spasmic 4-halt day. Remember, popcorn didn't have any halts that day. If I were to guess what happened, popcorn's price went so low that a small hedgie became undercollateralized, received a margin call, couldn't meet margin, and suffered force liquidation.\n\n**Let's zoom in to around that point, May 12 - June 6, shall we?**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x8lqddu0x5491.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50df79c9d4edb9baf10f34d1f5eb4d6d0d0f005d\n\nAs we can see, what happened from the lows of May 12, 2022 to the present is EXACTLY what happened with the long term price action of Jan-June 2021. GME has an intensive, halt-inducing breakout sneeze. Popcorn follows. They both stabilize. And then popcorn has its own mini-pump. And this has happened TWICE the past month. Just like other posts have mentioned, we seem to be able to see recursive patterns in the algos, from larger time frames down to the smaller time frames, until they start to unwind. I can only hypothesize that these price actions reflect somebody holding popcorn as collateral is becoming undercollateralized, and is then having to scrounge for liquidity to pump up their collateral some time afterwards.\n\n# So what does this mean for GME and popcorn?\n\nAs the hedgies who are long on popcorn and DON'T have a short position on GME, they will trade away their position over time to avoid losses. As this happens, the popcorn longs that ARE holding short positions (via the total return swap) will be forced to pump more and more liquidity into their popcorn longs to stop from being margin-called. But, there will come a day when the kool-aid drunk friends become sober, and their algos start to trade against the descending valuation. When this day comes, Hedgie A's liquidity will receive diminishing returns, and his precious collateral will be moving against him.\n\n**And then there will be a day when Hedgie A can no longer meet margin. What happens when someone fails to meet margin? Their collateral gets force liquidated. And what do we think their main collateral is?** I dunno, maybe hotdogs or something.\n\nWe can already see GME is winning the battle. We're starting to make higher highs and higher lows, and popcorn is making lower highs and lower lows. GME has overtaken the marketcap lead considerably. If anything, this tells me swaps could be blowing up soon, unless they post additional collateral.\n\nAgain, this is all SPECULATION. I have no hard evidence, only circumstantial evidence based on institutional holdings matched with TA volumes and price action during specific time frames. If anyone can point out flaws in my data points or lines of thinking, please feel free. I am a very smooth brained ape when it comes to financial matters, and all I know how to do is eat crayons and draw lines with them.

I had coded the tool with my own hands but still, the I was very cautious in while making the initial investments based on the suggestion provided by InvestR. Only after waiting for sometime and watching how those decisions unfolded did I get more confidence to make more investments based on the tool's suggestions. It took me close to 9 months to be reasonably confident in the tool that I had created! (All this while I was also tweaking the algorithms and adding features that help me make a decision)\n\nSo people will trust any tool, be it MarketMojo or InvestR, only if it has made them money. And for the tool to make them money they need to have at least some confidence in it to make an initial small investments based on the tool's suggestions.\n\nSome tools might work for certain people. Some people prefer spoon feeding (just give me the stock name and I will buy it) while some prefer to dig deeper, using the tool only as a starting point.\n\nSo, someone will say they like MarketMojo and someone will say they did not. Eventually it depends on YOU if you are going to trust it. And YOU will not trust it till it (the tool) proves to YOU by making YOU some money. It looks like a chicken or egg situation. It can be broken by making small investments based on the tool and watch those decisions unfold!\n\nHope that helped!\n\nEdit:\n\nOne more thing. Sometimes people will like a tool (or an analysts or friend) because of confirmation bias. That is, if I like Hexaware Tech and some tool (or analysts or friend) suggests the same then I will end up liking that tool (or analysts or friend) as they confirmed my thought process. But whether both of us were right or wrong will be proven only if the stock price behave as predicted by the tool (or analysts or friend)."}

My full time pays me between $70k-$105k depending on overtime availability. One of my coworkers is adamant that there is a certain income threshold one should not exceed because in his exact words \"once you reach that level you pay so much in federal and state income taxes you are loosing money.\" Forgive me, but this sounds beyond ridiculous. A quick look at the tax brackets (yes I already know you only pay 10% on the first $10k, then the next % up to a certain point), under no circumstance does someone actually start to loose money... Or do they? What on earth is my coworker talking about?","answer":"Your co-worker doesn't understand that the tax bracket is a marginal tax rate. If you get a raise, you will *always* make more.

You paid \"only\" 24% on the dollars between $89,076 and $170,050.\n\nYour co-worker mistakenly thinks something like this:\n\n* If I make $170,050, I will pay 24% tax, and will take home $129,238 (I pay 24% of $170,050 to the government)\n* If I make $170,051, I am now \"in a higher tax bracket,\" I will pay 32% tax, and will take home $115,634 (I pay 32% of $170,051 to the government)\n\nThe important thing is that it is a bracket. You pay 10% of the first $10,275, then 12% of ONLY the amount between $10,276 to $41,775, then 22% of ONLY the dollars between $41,776 and $89,075, etc.\n\nHere is when it is useful to consider tax brackets. Suppose you are married filing single and you get a raise so that now you make $175,000 per year instead of $170,000. This $5,000 (rounding it) is in the 32% tax bracket. If you take an action to reduce your taxable income, you are protecting those dollars from the 32% tax rate. Here are some ways to reduce taxable income:\n\n* Contribute to a pre-tax retirement plan such as a 401(k)\n* If you itemize deductions (rare these days), increase your deductions such as charitable donations\n* Increase your pre-tax contributions to savings accounts like FSAs, HSAs, or DCFSA (daycare\/dependent care)"}
{"question":"Tenant paying for laundry utilities  \n\nNot sure if this is the best subreddit for this kind of advice, but I thought I'd give it a shot:\n\nI\u2019m in a bit of a pickle with the laundry room at my triplex and could use some guidance.\n\nI bought the property in 2013 and moved into the front house. As a convenience for everyone, I discontinued the coin-op laundry contract and bought a new washer and dryer for everyone to use. I moved out years ago, so this is now purely an investment property.\n\nThe units are all detached, however the laundry room is attached to back unit. The laundry room has always been on the same gas\/electric meter as the back unit, so the tenant has always paid the gas\/electric expense. I pay for water for the property. This tenant is great - low maintenance, never complains, and takes great care of the unit.\n\nOver the last several years, utility rates have shot through the roof in San Diego. The other tenants are running (hogging) the machines constantly. The tenant has provided me with her utility bills. Electric usage has gone up significantly (\\~55%) since she moved in several years ago.\n\nThe machines are breaking at least every 6 months; my appliance guy says this is mostly due to pet fur (there are now 5 dogs on the property). This seems like the time for me bring in a coin-op laundry company back into the fold (pun not intended?). It will eliminate my laundry repair expense and bring in a minor revenue stream to help pay for the water utilities.\n\nThe question is what to do about the tenant in the back unit? I imagine that because the tenants will have to pay for their laundry, they will be more responsible about their usage. However I feel having the tenant now pay for laundry on top of the fact she\u2019s paying for the utilities would simply not be fair to her and will send her packing. Would you recommend a credit of some kind? If so, what would it look like?\n\nThanks for reading and thanks in advance for your insights!","answer":"Give the tenant the money from the coin op Machines.

{"question":"Finally got my first mortgage at 42 and here\u2019s what I learnt 1. Get a mortgage broker but also use your own judgement re: their advice. I didn\u2019t get what all the fuss was about getting a broker but they essentially helped me to get a lower interest rate and no LMI when using 15% deposit. I had 20% deposit and had previously been contacting banks by myself for pre-approval. They would comb through my bank statements so had to be very careful with my spending, but with a broker, they only needed 3payslips and that was it. Broker did advise to borrow way more for investment property which I didn\u2019t want, so stuck to my guns as I don\u2019t want to be stressing about the repayments.\n\n2. Use a buyer\u2019s agent (BA) if you can. I wasn\u2019t aware that some offer an option where they bid for you at the auction only for about $1300 which sounds a lot but considering how panicked I was and the desperate lengths I would have gone to get the property, it was well worth it. They saved me at least 30k and left to my own devices, at least 100k. For this option, I did my own research and I knew the market well so much so when I was talking to a few BA\u2019s about what and where I wanted to buy, most didn\u2019t think it could be done for what I was willing to pay. However, I was able to provide them the relevant comparators in the same market and how prices were falling, which showed I wasn\u2019t being unrealistic. \n\n3. Read your contract yourself. They buried the fact that there was asbestos in the bathrooms way into the 174 page contract, but because I read through it I was able to ask my solicitor to find out more about this. I was initially put off till I found out that a lot of properties built before 1982 would contain asbestos so I would have to deal with the issue regardless. I got quotations for how much it would cost to update the bathrooms without disturbing the walls and also for full renovations, so knew my options beforehand.\n\n4. I listened to a lot of free podcasts on being a first Home buyer and much as people like to hate, the barefoot investor helped me a lot on this journey. I\u2019ve gone from being a spendaholic to being relatively frugal :) so there\u2019s some hope for people with partners that like to spend a lot. There\u2019s quite a few podcasts that explain in great detail the whole home buying process.\n\n5. I sacrificed my life for years to get the deposit and worked 2 jobs as a nurse. I hope to never have to work 2 jobs again but am grateful for the opportunities Australia has given me, because being an immigrant I\u2019ve had to try and support myself whilst also looking after family back home so it certainly wasn\u2019t easy for me. \n\n6. I learnt to compromise. I got most of what I wanted in the property and it\u2019s in a great location for me. I decided that if I went up to my purchase limit, I could live with an unrenovated kitchen and bathroom whilst I saved up. Thankfully it won\u2019t be for long.\n\n7. Now that I have a place, am still quite pleased to see prices falling, contrary to popular belief. Renting sucks and homes should be more affordable for everyone IMO.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards! :)","answer":"Well done. You've sacrificed a lot to be where you are.

Every penny you put in your trading account should be considered lost. Full stop. You're not buying a lotto ticket, you are buying the right to learn a skill very few (percentage-wise) have.\n\n2. Cut your losses. If you make 1% a day for the entire year, you 37x your money. You are trying too hard to make it fast. Trading is a balance between risk and time. You want to go fast, you need to take risks. But it's pointless when you consider the power of compounding gains. Does 1% a day seem hard to you?(It's a genuine question, not being facetious in any way). If it does seem hard to you, then maybe you can dial it back a bit on your risk profile.

You can argue with inflation, but the point is trading is a marathon. Stop treating it like a sprint. Every time I tried to sprint, I destroyed my account."}
{"question":"Bitcoin may NEVER return to previous heights, and a lot of you are worrying me. I see a lot of people excited about cryptocurrency buying into these low prices. This is a generally good strategy, but I would posit this is not a good strategy for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an asset we really don't understand. Further, it's not the only asset of its kind, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, there are FAR better alternatives already in existence.\n\nTrying to dollar cost average on Bitcoin could very well end up with you not only trying to catch a falling knife, but repeatedly stabbing yourself in the foot with it while several of us around you happened to put our money in newer technology. \n\nAll I'm trying to say with this post is this:\n\nThis could very well be the beginning of a major move away from \"silly\" money (pouring billions into Bitcoin, something that is worth what it is ONLY because it was the first, and for literally no other reason), and very much so a move towards investing in projects with better technology. If this is the case, which I suspect it could be, those of you deciding to hold onto Bitcoin could have an extremely unpleasant outcome.\n\nEdit: People calling me an idiot, asking if I'm being sarcastic. I'm truly not. If you haven't looked into the many interesting projects happening in this area as we speak, I suggest you do so. If you think that Bitcoin adds a value proposition that none of the other \"coins\" can offer, please enlighten me.\n\nEdit2: I'm a computer science guy who enjoys graph theory and cryptography; I actually read the whitepapers most of you gloss over. I'm not saying this as a \"Bitcoin hater\", but rather as a technology and theory enthusiast within the space.\n\nEdit3: BILLIONS of dollars are being sucked out of the market as we speak. The market cap is currently only at 300 billion dollars. It was over 800 billion at one point. The cryptocurrency space is vastly different than it was one year ago. When this money re-enters the market, it may not be in a similar manner as of last time.\n\nEdit4: Market cap is not a 1-to-1 pairing with actual invested fiat. Market cap = price of coin * shares in existence. I should have clarified further, that not only is the market cap rapidly dropping, but if you look at the past few days, billions of dollars are being removed from the market as we speak.\n\nEdit5: I've had to comment in response to many mentions of the price correlation issue. I would expect that the introduction of more fiat\/crypto pairs will lead to a reduction in price correlation to Bitcoin. Most alternatives are only available through non-standard means, and so one must go through bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, or bitcoin cash (Coinbase availabilities) to get coins offered on binance or other crypto only exchanges. This is one of my biggest concerns in cryptocurrency at the moment.","answer":"BTC, the gateway drug. Used to the gateway to altcoin... Now there are other pairs.

{"question":"Petition to Disallow Citadel Being Exempt from the 1940 Investment Company Act Like many of you, I try to read as much DD as possible, though I have to admit I don\u2019t understand a lot of it. One good recent example is this post from u\/thabat :\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/pcklz0\/rolling\\_in\\_the\\_deep\\_dive\\_hiding\\_money\\_in\\_the\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/pcklz0\/rolling_in_the_deep_dive_hiding_money_in_the\/)\n\nIt builds on other DD u\/Criand has done to explain how SHF are able to hide money and shorts in the Caymans. If you haven\u2019t read it yet, you really should. Now, as I said, I didn\u2019t understand all of it, but there was one part that really stuck out to me, which was the discussion of the 1940 Investment Company Act:\n\n[https:\/\/www.govinfo.gov\/content\/pkg\/COMPS-1879\/pdf\/COMPS-1879.pdf](https:\/\/www.govinfo.gov\/content\/pkg\/COMPS-1879\/pdf\/COMPS-1879.pdf)\n\n\u201cThis Act regulates the organization of companies, including mutual funds, that engage primarily in investing, reinvesting, and trading in securities, and whose own securities are offered to the investing public.\u00a0**The regulation is designed to minimize conflicts of interest**\u00a0that arise in these complex operations.\u00a0**The Act requires these companies to disclose their financial condition and investment policies to investors when stock is initially sold and, subsequently, on a regular basis.**\u00a0The focus of this Act is on disclosure to the investing public of information about the fund and its investment objectives, as well as on investment company structure and operations. It is important to remember that the Act\u00a0**does not permit the SEC to directly supervise the investment decisions or activities of these companies or judge the merits of their investments.**\u201d\n\nSounds good right? Except that apparently \u201cCitadel files exemption from these rules every year since 2009 and is instantly granted.\u201d\n\n[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/cgi-bin\/browse-edgar?filenum=813-00397&amp;action=getcompany](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/cgi-bin\/browse-edgar?filenum=813-00397&amp;action=getcompany)\n\nSo this seems pretty obviously bad to me. I don\u2019t understand why a monolithic investment firm should be allowed to be exempt from a bunch of laws that seem to directly pertain to them and their activities \u2018just because they want to be.\u2019 It has made me very angry (along with all the other BS this year, of course), and so I\u2019m taking action, and I hope you\u2019ll all join me.\n\nI\u2019ve created a petition at Change.org with the goal of imploring the SEC to disallow Citadel from being exempted from the 1940 Investment Company Act. Now, I know what you might be thinking \u2013\u00a0you see these Change.org petitions pop up all the time, with people wanting you to support this and that cause, and you\u2019re doubtful if they can actually have any impact; but if we can harness the power of the worldwide Ape movement and get MILLIONS of signatures, and then blast it at every relevant government official and agency, well, you never know. Something could happen.\n\nSo here\u2019s the petition:\n\n([https:\/\/chng.it\/wK2qdMCCNF](https:\/\/chng.it\/wK2qdMCCNF))\n\nI will be cross-posting this to all relevant subreddits, and I ask that you share it with as many people as you can. Let\u2019s see what we can do.\n\n**EDIT 1:**\n\nu\/[LegateLaurie](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/LegateLaurie) has brought up an interesting point:\n\n\"The 40 Act is designed for mutual funds where the general public buy shares. Companies regulated by the 40 Act are forced to have greater disclosure and certain kinds of compensation for managers (it's hard\/impossible for ETF or mutual fund managers to have performance based pay (unless it's fulcrum fees)).\n\n&gt;whose own securities are offered to the investing public\n\nNote, Citadel does not, and cannot sell securities to the \"investing public\" due to their exemption from the 40 Act.\n\nHedge funds aren't meant to be regulated by the 40 Act, as only qualified investors are allowed to invest in them. This means the funds can take on more risk and don't need to disclose as much. Managers also take far higher fees.\n\nThe reason that these firms have an exemption is to be able to take on far greater risk than the SEC believes is appropriate for the general public. This regulation came about in the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash where many members of the public were defrauded and where fund managers profited hugely with performance based fees meanwhile people lost out huge amounts of money.\n\nIt is not like opting out of other regulations, because to opt out of the 40 Act means that the fund can only sell securities to \"Qualified Investors\" (a net worth of over a million or income over $200k).\"\n\nSo, okay. That might all be the legal reasoning behind the exemption; however, it still points to an unfair and imbalanced system where 'qualified investors' (i.e. the rich) can 'take on more risk' (i.e. do whatever they want) and have way less oversight on them. So it's still all bullshit.\n\nSo if the Act doesn't apply to Citadel and other HFs, we need NEW STRONGER OVERSIGHT LAWS that do.\n\n**EDIT 2:**\n\nu\/thabat has replied in the comments that the above is actually FUD:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/pefy3t\/petition\\_to\\_disallow\\_citadel\\_being\\_exempt\\_from\/haxw4k0\/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/pefy3t\/petition_to_disallow_citadel_being_exempt_from\/haxw4k0\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n**Edit 3:**\n\nMore on the above discussion:\n\n[https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/pefy3t\/petition\\_to\\_disallow\\_citadel\\_being\\_exempt\\_from\/hayhg2q\/](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/pefy3t\/petition_to_disallow_citadel_being_exempt_from\/hayhg2q\/)","answer":"\"Let's make a rule you can exempt yourself from for no stated reason.\"\n\nI wish the rest of the rules had that as an option.

{"question":"The Epic v Apple Ruling might have a bigger impact on Apple stock than you realize. I made a video about the Epic vs Apple court case this weekend.  I think the ruling requiring Apple to allow Devs to send users outside of the Apple eco system could have a larger impact on EPS than I had initially expected to find.  \n\nOne of the researchers Epic called to testify said the App Store brings in about $22B in revenue and has about 70% profit margin.  That\u2019s roughly half of the entire services segment for Apple so this isn\u2019t an inconsequential part of the business.  \n\nI made a video taking a look at what this would mean for Apple\u2019s EPS if they were to lose no profit, 25%, and 80% from the App Store.  \n\nI personally really like correlating growth rates to a P\/E value.  Some may call this pricing vs valuing, but I\u2019ve done this for a long time and it\u2019s been very reliable.  Of course though, determining what you should pay is far more than [growth rate + P\/E] so don\u2019t get the wrong idea that this is all I\u2019m doing.  \n\nI ended up using a growth rate of 12% for Apple which I correlate to a 28 P\/E.\n\nI looked at EPS estimates for 2021, 2022, and 2023 and found if there\u2019s no profit impact apples stock will be worth $166.

But depending on how devs and users react it is something to monitor. \n\n70% App Store revenue comes only from 10% of App Store users mostly from playing games so it\u2019s not as diverse of a user base as you might expect.  \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in my full video here\u2019s a [Link](https:\/\/youtu.be\/p6Oq_NjPp4Y) \n 10:42","answer":"They are going to lose zero dollars from this ruling.

{"question":"Those who climbed corporate ladder, is\/was it worth it? I recently got a new job in my career field (IT). I'm a well paid senior level engineer and very much have enjoyed the tech world so far. Throughout my career, and increasingly so, I've been told by people I've worked with (internal to the company, external, and managers in this most recent hiring process) they think I could make a good leader in management tracks. Which I'm not against exploring further. \n\nHowever, I also have seen numerous family members rise to high levels within various orgs (from C level execs, to directors of large divisions in massive companies), and it always seems to take a big toll on work\/life balance. \n\nI know many here are in the STEM realm, and I believe a decent amount have done\/tried management. So, I'm curious about others experiences in management vs individual contributor roles. What has been good, bad, or neutral in your experience with whichever path you went? Would you do it again? ","answer":"I did NOT climb the corporate ladder.  People I know who did spent many years working 60-80 hours a week, including most weekends and missing family events, kids' birthdays and even holidays.  Some of them traveled extensively and weren't even home for much of the time.  In the end, they became bitter, usually divorced, quite wealthy and more or less happy with how their life turned out:  wealthy and alone.\n\nEntrepreneurs I have known have either failed and gone back to work, or succeeded wildly beyond even what the corporate climbers did, and for the most part worked hard but not to the exclusion of all family life.  They seem happier, certainly wealthier, and for the most part stayed working in their businesses, even after they were FI.\n\nPeople shooting for low six figures and parleying that into FI, usually in their 40's or 50's, seem to not work excessively, have happier personal lives and may be jealous of the wealth of the corporate climbers or founders, but also seem happy with where they ended up.

If you've ever dabbled in leveraged inverse products that are thinly traded in the OTC market, you're taking it to a whole new level....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As little as a few days ago, it traded at $400 a share. A week later, it was at more than $24,000. Today, it's back down to a \"modest\" $13,000.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, how does a delisted triple-leveraged inverse natural gas exchange-traded note (yes, that's a lot to say) increase 60-fold over the matter of a week? The short answer is we don't know for sure, but we have some ideas. There's a lot to unpack here, so let's take it step by step.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[seems legit](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lsyucyz784r91.png?width=1424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c02f1771b8cd777f62042b6af58c0675b9f1d337)\n\n&gt;History Of DGAZF  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DGAZF is the over-the-counter version of the now delisted\u00a0**VelocityShares Daily 3x Inverse Natural Gas ETN (DGAZ).**\u00a0Back in June, I wrote about Credit Suisse deciding to delist its suite of ETNs in order to \"better align its product suite with its broader strategic growth plans\". I focused on the gold and silver ETNs closing in the article and only mentioned the natural gas ETNs in passing, not realizing they'd become the big story more than a month later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[you mean debit suisse?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f6rbss3074r91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dd2318e680b5fd108c4beffb765d323448a1e86)\n\n&gt;The problem is that Credit Suisse didn't actually close the note altogether. It merely delisted it, which is the equivalent of just letting it die a slow death. Since it got moved to the OTC market and became DGAZF, it's still available to trade, but it's a very thinly traded market susceptible to all kinds of trading quirks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;By the end of the trading day on Monday, it began trading at 27 times its NAV. In other words, some traders were willing to pay $3500 for roughly $120 of assets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;How Did This Happen?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As far as I can tell, there's nothing nefarious at play here, but there is perhaps some irresponsible behavior.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The root of the problem comes from Credit Suisse deciding to delist DGAZ and let it drift to the OTC market instead of just closing it out altogether. Credit Suisse still makes fees on the notes, so perhaps that's part of the reason, but if you're essentially going to abandon it, you're doing a disservice to investors who happen to stumble across it or decide to trade it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[another ETN in recent news was Barclays formerly shuttered VXX](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qwnl9la674r91.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82002722f1169764f0f5acd7dc9920a283bacfcb)\n\n&gt;Another contributing factor is the fact that no new shares of DGAZF are being issued. That leaves investors who 3x negative exposure to natural gas fighting for what few shares are available on the market. ETFs, for example, have a creation\/redemption mechanism in place that largely keeps shares trading at or near their underlying NAV.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DGAZF is essentially trading like a rare coin now. If there are only a handful available in the world, collectors might be willing to pay a crazy premium above its value in order to get their hands on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dgl16pxwb4r91.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=668b5a5e311114b1b2437c6de3a1f11787b78099\n\n&gt;I think that's exactly what we're seeing here  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The only logical answer is that Credit Suisse needs to officially close the ETN. This has already been suggested by a few other observers and I couldn't agree more. Letting this float out there in the OTC market like it has is creating a dangerous situation for unwitting investors and some are inevitably going to experience huge losses.\n\nEDIT: For those wondering, u\/takeshiro posted a recent screenshot on extorter's take on why these ETNs might matter\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/r2rymefs84r91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ed7f14235ec2016f8139d62b4d0796b9c3c053a\n\nEDIT 2: interesting note from an article on another Barclays ETN that got delisted:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/k2octgnnb4r91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0ccebe2722b2d179d7633b49b8bef2441114bc0\n\n&gt;SHORT SQUEEZE CANDIDATE  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**For VXX - a heavily shorted instrument with about 90% of its shares sold short - the halt of share creation makes it a prime candidate for a potential short squeez**e, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, said.Short sellers sell borrowed shares, looking to make a profit by buying back the shares at a later date at a lower price.

Nice.\n\nHowever, they have a major tenant, Steward, that has struggled during the pandemic, because Steward's profitability is down.  During the pandemic, hospitals were unable to perform nearly as many elective procedures during the pandemic due to the number of hospital beds\/space devoted to pandemic treatment.  No elective procedures means a lot less money\/profit for Steward.\n\nIt seems that Steward's tenancy makes up 20% of MPW's holdings.  That doesn't seem too diversified to me. To counter Steward's slide, MPW made some sort of loan to Steward to prop them up.

{"question":"\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f Proxy Voting DD - How the count works and timeline of the voting process # Hello fellow apes! \ud83e\udd8d\n\nFirst of all, this is not financial advice. Do not take anything I say here as the absolute truth. Make your own due diligence and take your own conclusions.\n\nAll of you know, GameStop released its proxy statement on April 22. I personally can not vote since I have my shares in eToro but **please**, vote as soon as you can. Your vote is extremely important and the board urged us to vote ASAP.\n\nI am feeling very anxious today. Rainy saturday here in Uruguay so I decided to [take a few hits](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AQ2WO_u0Ork) and do some DD on the proxy voting process of GME to keep that confirmation bias going.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m48drdf9i7v61.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e38aac59868545af595b0a7c3c2062571109589\n\nI've been **JACKED TO THE TITS** since the 14A filling because the **final vote count** can show how there are much more *\"shares\"* than the real available float, proving beyond any doubt the naked shorting and manipulation that we all know is taking place.\n\nSo, you may be wondering: ***Do we have to wait until the shareholder meeting date for the truth to be uncovered?***\n\n# I think not. Or at least that's what this DD is about. Let's get into it!\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/44seg2lzo7v61.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e90360a0a6720c717bdf06907e0486cda9c12c9\n\n# How are the shareholder votes counted?\n\nThis is actually stated in the [proxy document](https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001193125-21-126940\/#toc122967_28), page 12:\n\n&gt;**9.\u2009\u2009Who Counts the Votes?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have engaged Computershare, our transfer agent, as our inspector of elections to receive and tabulate votes. Computershare will separately tabulate \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cagainst\u201d votes, abstentions and broker non-votes. Computershare will also certify the results and determine the existence of a quorum and the validity of proxies and ballots.\n\nOkay so let's do some research on Computershare! If we go to [their website](https:\/\/www.computershare.com\/) we can see they do a lot of things, but we specifically want to focus on the proxy voting specifics.\n\nThis is not about the count itself, but it's nice: [GameStop is prepared to have a virtual shareholder meeting](https:\/\/www.computershare.com\/us\/business\/issuer-services\/shareholder-meetings), supposedly using the latest tech.\n\nOk, back to the count. In the \"Business\" menu, we can see there is a section for \"Corporate Governance &amp; Proxy Services\". Here there are links to different pages showcasing the different capabilities of Computershare's Proxy Services.\n\n[Computershare site showing the shit ton of things they do](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/da6g1jryi7v61.png?width=2414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20285720242cf11a76728cd5131e9e31a9cea6a8)\n\nWe are interested in the [Optimize corporate issuer proxy outcomes](http:\/\/www.georgeson.com\/us\/business\/proxy-solicitation\/prepare-for-shareholder-meetings) section specifically. This links takes us to another site of a Computershare company: Georgeson.\n\nI believe Georgeson is the part of Computershare that manages the proxy services for [corporate issuers](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/i\/issuer.asp), like GameStop.\n\n**Here is the juicy part:**\n\n[\\\\\"During any live shareholder engagement program we closely monitor your votes daily using integrated vote tracking platforms. You get actionable, real time vote reports.\\\\\"](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4arhi4ccj7v61.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f0f766ea85d6bc4d3ad6cdee415f45726201d71)\n\nI believe the last sentence is extremely important. Let's dissect what it means:\n\n* **Real-time:** GameStop has access to real-time, live count of the votes. It's not like they have to wait until the voting process is over to know the count.\n* **Actionable:** I speak English, but it's not my native language so I googled the definition of \"actionable\" just in case:\n\n[Basically, I understand it means that it can be used \\\\\"in a legal manner\\\\\"](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1sse1xqer7v61.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63b0dd9ec6538b3371991d01f73a6ee706d6e6dd)\n\nAlso, in this [\"Proxy Solicitation &amp; Corporate Governance Solutions\"](https:\/\/www-us.computershare.com\/content\/download.asp?docId=%7B9D6D5536-F0AD-4BF0-BECD-BA50A08971E1%7D&amp;cc=US&amp;lang=en&amp;bhjs=0&amp;theme=cpu) Georgeson PDF document:\n\n&gt;**UPDATES ON VOTING RESULTS**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Once voting results become available, **we will provide daily reports detailing the progress of the solicitation**. In addition, we are the only firm that provides **real-time tabulation updates** (including major unvoted positions) on the Internet, which you can access using a unique company code and password.\n\n# HOLY MOLY\n\n# So, basically this means that GameStop not only knows the live vote count, but they can also use the voting reports in legal action.\n\nIf our theory is that GameStop will inform some entity of this issue and recall the shares (not really sure how that would play out, if someone knows please let me know in the comments) this implies that **they could legally do it as soon as they see that \"*****the count is off*****\".**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hmm...

I believe this means they are really doing their best to speed up things. **I like the stock.**\n\nAccording to the calculator, Georgeson should start sending GameStop voting reports **13 business days after the SEC filing.**\n\n# So we can estimate that GameStop should receive their first voting reports around 5\/11\n\n**EDIT 1:** It has been brought to my attention that I may have been reading too much into the \"actionable\" definition:\n\n&gt;**By** u\/umisen-yamasen  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(2) \"actionable\" isn't a term of art, it just means whoever uses their service can use\/rely on the voting results generated quickly to pass resolutions, without having to tabulate the votes slowly. I am exposed to similar service providers such as this in my work and I can tell you that it is highly unlikely there is any double meaning here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 2:**\n\nAfter doing some more research on over-voting, it seems that there are strategies in place to make the final vote count match the DTCC share count. I'm gonna do part 2 of this DD, clarifying things that I may have overstated here.\n\nHowever, I believe this makes sense for the voting process itself, but assuming a ridiculous vote count (like many times over the actual shares) GameStop can release this information, and we can put public pressure so SOMEONE makes something about it.\n\n**TL;DR:** GameStop will have access to a real-time vote count and daily reports around 5\/11, and ~~it seems that those reports can be used in a \"legal\" manner.~~","answer":"Gamestop can sue the likes of Melvin.

These \"little\" changes will certainly help.\n\nI don't undertand, it seems like you *have* balanced your finances.  Yes, you don't have anything left at the end of the month, but that's because you're in the absolute most expensive stage of life (city rents and children in daycare).  \n\nAll you have to do is wait three years and all of a sudden you'll have that daycare money coming in and feel like you have more money than you know what to do with.\n\nIt's actually pretty normal to be financially stretched when you have young kids.  Not saying it's not stressful, but you don't have to feel bad because you're not banking a load of money every month."}

{"question":"Would you invest some of your portfolio in a very volatile investment with the potential for massive gains but the risk of a brutal loss? I was thinking of setting aside 10% of my stock portfolio for gambling.  Not casino gambling but stock market gambling.  Stocks, ETFs, Mutual Funds, and other investments I can buy through Fidelity Investments that have the potential to make me lots of money in a very short time, but also have the potential to drop rapidly in a period of market turmoil.\n\nHere is an example of what I am talking about:  **TQQQ** (TQQQ is a levered fund that delivers 3x exposure only over a one-day holding period of NASDAQ-100 stocks. The underlying index includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on NASDAQ based on market capitalization.)\n\nIf I had invested $10,000 in TQQQ ten years ago it would be worth $797,065 today.  But it went for a wild ride during the last ten years. Even in an era of a booming stock market, it dropped 49.2% during a market correction. The worst was during last Spring when the COVID crisis scared the stock market.  But if I ignored all the ups and downs I would be rich if I sold it today.\n\nDuring the last 12 months, TQQQ went up 172%.\n\nThere are other investments that are similar.  What do you think of putting some of your money in a similarly high risk but high potential reward investment?","answer":"Yes absolutely. I feel many people should learn about pott odds and bankroll management which are poker terms. It will help them with their risk management.\n\nYour opponent bets $250, making the pot total 3000.  You would have to put $250 in the pot to get a chance to win 3K.\nSo you'd potentially make 3K on a $250 investment. You can lose this bet 12 times and win 1 time to break even. Y\n\nIn poker you made an estimated guess on your opponents hand and figure out what percentage they have to win. If you feel you can win this bet more than 8.33% of the time, if you were to play this exact same hand thousands of time, in the long run you make money, even if you loose the current hand. \n\nIf you have less than an 8.33% chance to win, because you strongly feel the opponent has you massively beat, even if you get lucky and win the hand, in the long run you will loose money by making that bet. The skill is poker is disguising your hand so the opponent guesses wrong, this effectively takes luck out of the long term game and you win or loose money based on your skill at reading hands and disguising your own.\n\nBankroll management means never putting a huge chunk of money into 1 game, because if you loose or get into a bad luck streak, you can grind to make it all back because being unlucky doesn't last forever and the bad luck will happen multiple times during a career. \n\nWhen you make this \"risky investment\" you need to calculate that if you make this same investment millions of times you will earn more money than you lose. This is one of the reasons I invested in GME with a smaller position and didn't YOLO.  I feel the short term is risky, but the long term risk is quite low. The short term payoff is potentially massive, the longterm payoff is high."}

{"question":"One more call with Dr. Metzler: He is asking for investors of ETFs and other Funds who hold Evergrande bonds to ask if these institutions have received their payments! The Internet might be able to help him to prove that Evergrande and Co are lying! Follow up post in this one: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/qus0oh\/brief\\_update\\_on\\_the\\_dmsa\\_dr\\_metzler\\_and\\_their\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/qus0oh\/brief_update_on_the_dmsa_dr_metzler_and_their\/)\n\nFirst off, this will likely be my last post on Dr. Metzler and today could have been the last the call with him. Everything is fine, but i think my job here is done. I wanted to proof to the community that he and DMSA are real and i think i did that. I pointed out that people who are interested about the topic, should follow him on [Linkedin](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/dr-marco-metzler-403341163\/). And it's nice to see that his posts are being seen by more people.\n\nTo make that perfectly clear, i am a GME holder, want to see Kenny G in jail and want my tendies. \n\nDRS is the way.\n\nBut still. If Evergrande is the trigger for global market correction aka crash, that will influence GME in the short term. Don't know in which direction, but doens't change a thing that MOASS will come.\n\nStill im genuinely interested into the Evergrande crisis, as we basically face the same institutions that are covering up, are responsible for the crisis of 2008 and swim in the same water as Kenny G. &amp; Co.\n\nAlso i think guys, we can't deny it. I know it hurts. But i think we grew some wrinkles in the last 11 months and i value superstonk as place where a a lot of people are well informed about the market and we all feel that a crash is coming based on given facts.\n\n**About the call:**\n\n* The DMSA has published [a report about the Chinese Wealth Managment Products](https:\/\/www.dmsa-agentur.de\/download\/20211112_DMSA_WMP_ST_en.pdf), which is a giant market (27,950 billion yuan \/ US$4,370 billion according to them) which might see massive decline due to the Evergrande Crisis.\n* The DMSA also published a [report about the Losses of funds with largest Evergrande bond exposure](https:\/\/www.dmsa-agentur.de\/download\/20211117_DMSA_EVG_ST_en.pdf). UBS, Fidelity and Ashmore have the biggest exposure, but Blackrock too.  \nSee for yourself. Note: This is a not the Fidelity, we all know.\n* They also will publish a report about CDS (Credit Default Swaps). Already briefly mentioned [here](https:\/\/www.dmsa-agentur.de\/download\/20211117_DMSA_EVG_PM_en.pdf).  \n *\"If Evergrande will be bankcrupt, the above funds would lose $9 billion in total year-to-date. This does not take into account real estate companies that are still well valued and which could also be on the verge of insolvency. The funds' losses then exceed the $10 billion mark,\" explains DMSA senior analyst Dr. Marco Metzler. It also shows that with only $1.2 billion of reported official Evergrande bond exposure, the losses are significantly higher than the nominal bond exposure by a factor of 10. \"The difference can only be explained by possible additional investments in other bonds from Chinese real estate developers and credit default swaps (CDS),\" analyzes Dr. Metzler. According to a research report by investment bank Goldman Sachs, the market's CDS exposure to Evergrande is said to be around $158 billion. \"This shows that extent of the spill-over effects of the Evergrande bankruptcy. In addition to the $23.7 billion in bonds, another $158 billion would then be lost,\" Dr. Metzler summarized.* \n* I passed him some of the top DD regarding inflation and the failure of the Fed from superstonk. He thanked me for that and said that they will also publish a report about that topic too.\n* He did not mention to me when he invested into these bonds, but he assured me that is eligible to file a request to Clearstream if the payments where made. Right now his bank is filling this requests on his behalf, as i can't to it directly as private investor. He still has not received any payments!\n* Some apes already saw his [Linkedin post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/qvzgcq\/dr_marco_metzler_with_an_evergrande_update\/hkzovpe\/) where asks for investors of the funds with Evergrande exposure to ask if these funds really received their payments from Evergrande.\n* These funds are:  \n*FIDELITY FUNDS - ASIAN HIGH YIELD FUND*  \n*UBS Lux Bond SICAV - Asian High Yield*   \n*Ashmore SICAV - Emerging Markets TR*  \n*Ashmore SICAV - Emerging Markets LC*  \n *IShares USD Asia High Yield Bond Index*   \n*PIMCO Asia High Yield Bond Fund*   \n*BlackRock Global Funds- Asian Tiger Bond*  \n*Fidelity Funds - Global Multi Asset Income*  \n *Eastspring Investments - Asian Bond*  \n*AB FCP I - Global High Yield Portfolio*\n* Dr. Metzler is asking for investors of these funds, to ask themselves if the payments where made by Evergrande. He stated that it is their right as an investor.  \nSo if you or anyone you know are such investors, fell free to contact the fund and send any valuable information\/proof to Dr. Metzler on Linkedin or via Mail (his mail can be found on the DMSA)\n* Maybe the internet can help this man on his quest for the seek of truth!  \nCrossposts for the win. \n\nThat's it from my side.   \n *...We Will Watch Your Career With Great Interest Dr. Metzler...*\n\nLets see what happens regarding his involvement into Evergrande. He assured me that they are still working hard to get everything working so that Evergrande will be declared defaulted.  \nAnd no. I don't have any kind of insider knowledge, everything i know, i have passed to the community.\n\nI'm out (most likely). See you guys on the moon.\n\n*p.s. i informed him on the correct use of hashtags (he is not doing the post by himself, the content yes but no the \"design\") also pointed out that he might want to use Twitter to increase his reach or maybe an AMA. As of now, he is not interested in doing an AMA, because he is working hard on the default and wants to focus on that.

Harmony's validation algorithm, called ***Effective Proof-of-Stake*** (EPoS), guarantees complete decentralization thanks to a system that combines stake delegation, compound interest on commissions deriving from participation in the network and double approval for slashing (the penalty imposed on validators that do not behave honestly). The efficiency of the Harmony ONE blockchain makes it suitable for a large variety of decentralized applications, some of which are already up and running:\n\n* **DeFi**: MochiSwap and Viper are two swap platforms that can already boast thousands of users and tens of millions of US dollars in TVL (total value locked, the amount of money deposited), with transactions and farming protocols that benefit from fast transactions and economic.\n* **NFT**: the nascent non-fungible-token market has recently also arrived on Harmony ONE, thanks to the daVinci platform, which at the moment has already collected over 740 artists and more than 6000 works in its catalog.\n* **Gaming**: even if no decentralized application is yet available, the speed of Harmony's blockchain would be at the center of a partnership with Animoca, the giant in the blockchain gaming sector behind Cryptokitties and which can boast licenses of brands such as Formula 1, Garfield and Atari .\n\nGreat emphasis was also placed on making the Harmony blockchain communicating with existing protocols: bridges with the Ethereum blockchain, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon (MATIC) are already active, allowing the creation and exchange of wrapped assets.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe proprietary token of the Harmony blockchain is ONE, which performs three fundamental functions:\n\n* **Staking**: the token is used for the validation of transactions through the usual Proof-of-Stake mechanism, providing an incentive to users to take part in the network.\n* **Fee**: ONE is used to pay for interactions with the Harmony blockchain, making it essential for moving or creating assets.\n* **Governance**: ONE owners can vote on the developments of the protocol, thus promoting its decentralization and community participation.  Initially created on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain network, the ONE token was moved to Harmony's proprietary blockchain starting in June 2019, one month after launch on the popular Binance exchange.  The ONE token has a maximum supply of 12,600,000,000 (12 billion and 600 million) and was launched on the market at a price of 0.0065 US dollars.\n\n# Where to store it?\n\nThe best hot wallets for ONE are TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.\n\n# Pros&amp;Cons\n\n\\*DISCLAIMER\\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person\n\n**Pros**\n\n1. Great devs team\n2. It has already a functional product\n3. Completely decentralized\n\n**Cons**\n\n1. Staking is not very user-friendly\n2. 1-block-time finality","answer":"I appreciate that you're bringing Harmony to attention but the Pros\/Cons don't do it justice here.\n\nIMO:\n\n\\- Its block time should be a positive. It's 2-second and they're aiming to make it 1-second in Q1 next year.\n\n\\- The transaction fees on Harmony are absolutely cheap, fractions of a cent, making DeFi Yield Farming viable.\n\n\\- Staking (9% APR) is very easy through the Blits app. I recommend checking out the Harmony sub, the community there is extremely helpful in guiding and answering people's questions about staking.\n\n\\- It already has sharding for scalability which is a feature not available yet on ETH 2.0.\n\n\\- Upcoming 1Wallet (in beta currently) introduces social recovery which is a game-changer for user-friendly wallets. No more mnemonics or private keys needed, can be accessed by Google Authenticator.\n\n\\- Its partnership with Terra plans to bring 20% stablecoin savings (UST\/Anchor) for 1Wallet users.\n\n\\- Bridges: Ethereum, BSC, Bitcoin (end of October), Cosmos (end of Janurary 2022).\n\n\\- Harmony recently announced a $300M fund to fuel development on its ecosystem.\n\nEdit: Added more stuff"}
{"question":"Starbucks a good buy @current price? https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tuxse98n5y791.png?width=1051&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d2fbadae870d81e7115085b9fc7820475372608\n\nI have seen a few polar opinions on Starbucks but I struggle to understand why, I read on here that \"It's just a coffee shop\" which is far from the truth. In this post I want to go over some thoughts on Starbucks, take a look at the financials and key metrics and get opinions on whether you think it is a good purchase at its current price.\n\n**Overview**\n\nFor starters, globally Starbucks has more than 32,000 stores, but these stores are not the only source of revenue that Starbucks has. It also has canned beverages, merchandise and beans that it sells in retail outlets and online across the world. Lets also not forget the [over $1 Billion](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/starbucks-says-over-1-billion-is-sitting-on-cards-2022-5?r=US&amp;IR=T) that are currently sat on customer gift cards, which [Starbucks is taking advantage](https:\/\/thehustle.co\/starbucks-gift-cards-financing-borrowing\/) of by using it's customers as creditors.\n\nIn the UK and across Europe you can walk into any shop, be it a small shop on the corner of a street or a huge retail outlet, and find some kind of Starbucks product that is for sale. The brand is huge, globally known and still has room to expand, with the [management expecting to have 55,000](https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/starbucks-is-set-to-soar-on-reopening-and-expansion-plans-2021-04-02) stores globally by 2030.\n\n**Financials and Metrics**\n\n**Revenue**\n\nlooking at the revenue of Starbucks you can see consistent growth, the only slight wobble was a result of the various lockdowns across the word as a result of the pandemic.\n\n[Revenue Growth Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/t2potouj6y791.png?width=1650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab1b0774c8f7aa93227703a28dfcb249df1da179)\n\n[Revenue Growth](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/399f0zov6y791.png?width=2564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2247107f0f60a58814b3474fc48554427be7417)\n\nIf we take a look at earnings per share, we can also see consistent growth, growing from **1.38** in 2014 to **3.56** in 2021.\n\n[Earnings per share](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3b5w0fp67y791.png?width=2591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4d308e49b4a281bb2c462d499c3cb3dc88c1877)\n\n**Dividends**\n\nDividend metrics look good with a decent dividend, solid pay out ratio and room for growth.

{"question":"Worth learning the fundamentals of value investing at 15 y\/o? So I am currently 15 and have about 700$ in a s&amp;p 500 index fund. But I have always looked in awe towards the great investors such as buffet and graham, and would like to learn value investing. I know I probably won\u2019t be able to beat the s&amp;p but I would still like learn the fundamental ideas and strategies so I was wondering if it is possible for a 15 y\/o to get started considering how complicated everything seems at face value.","answer":"I started investing when I was 10 and started getting into lynch\/Graham at 14. Though, I think focusing on school (full ride to college) would be a better use of time. \n\nMake sure you nail your SATs (CRUCIAL)!!! Try to get great grades (take APs, IBs, and\/or DEs). Take these advanced classes so you can get college credit, they will save you money as well as make it financially easier to change your major (if you decide your initial major choice was not for you - a lot of people fit this description!). \n\nIf you have a job, open up a Roth IRA and invest the yearly max ($6000). I would strongly recommend investing that $6000 into VTI. If you have any extra money you can also put that into a custodial account and invest in VTI\/or a similar S&amp;P500 tracker. Most importantly, make sure to spend money on having fun too! \n\nOverall, what I would recommend is, if you want to learn value investing, do it with a paper money account (not real money). You can setup one of these on yahoo finance. By virtue of your age and inexperience, odds are you\u2019re going to fuck up single stock investing, at least initially\u2026 Hence, I would advise investing real $ into VTI and attempting value investing with fake $.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in knowing some resources to learning value investing, let me know and I\u2019ll tell you some of my favorites. FYI, your local library is a great source for value investing books. \n\nIf you don\u2019t plan on going to college or are not US based, not all of this will apply to you - sorry!!!"}

{"question":"I'm surprised this needed to be said. A lot of people don't really understand this situation we are in (more than 100% of the float shorted), so I will explain this to the smoothbrains out there TL;DR: **More than 100% of the float shorted -&gt; HF buys a share -&gt; gets canceled against a naked short\/synthetic share -&gt; People diamond hand -&gt; Infinity squeeze**\n\nIf there are more shares in existence than are supposed to be, a short squeeze is the closing of positions already sold, not the actual trading of stocks. They're buying shares to deliver to transactions already made in the past, not buying then selling. What has to happen is they then have to convince someone who purchased the stock long ago (but they just now delivered on) to then sell *back* to them, so they can deliver to someone else who purchased the stock *also* long ago. Then they have to repeat that until only 73M shares exist.\n\nThe big and important issue is what happens if you have 74M shares that are locked (either institution, insiders, or diamond hand retail)? You cannot close out the remaining 1M position ever. Now in that situation, I can imagine them just ignoring the extra 1M FTDs (especially considering they've been cruising with potentially 100s of millions of current FTDs). But if you have 150M shares that are locked, because retail owns 100M and 50M are locked by insiders and institutions who won't sell (or can't), it gets hard to ignore 77M shares during a margin call\/reconciliation. That's what creates the **infinity squeeze**.\n\nAn easier way of thinking about it is if the SI is over 100%, they're not even buying shares; they're paying us to close out our positions. If they have an open short position of 100M shares, then every time they buy a share it lowers their open short position, and they don't get a single share until their entire short position hits zero. It's like they took out a loan but the interest rate is 10,000,000%.\n\n# But then you might think about it and say something like:\n\nSI Might be over 100%, but some of the current owners of real shares will sell into that escalating market during the squeeze. And that means real shares will be circulating as well as a lot more fakes. Millions of real shares, probably, since not everyone or every institution is going to diamond hand.\n\nIf that's the case then it's *still* possible for them to buy, cover, the lender sell his newly covered shares, and the shorts buy and cover again. The deeper they are short the less this will matter, but it surely, inevitably means two things:\n\n1. They **can** cover without buying every single share available in the market no matter how short they are\n2. In which case, **the most expensive shares won't be traded**, and those people will end up being bagholders\n\nIf that's still correct, despite the &gt; 100% short scenario, then **we can't just set a price and guarantee we get it.**\n\n# Let me explain\n\nYou are correct in that SI doesn't matter, but it matters what portion of SI% is diamond-handed. That's why retail ownership is such an important number (if we consider retail as diamond handing for a while). Don't treat any individual share as real or fake. They aren't flagged as such. In the aggregate there are 73M real shares and X total shares, and there is nothing to differentiate the real or fake. The equation is simply that shorts must reduce the number of shares in the market to 73M. If there are 200M shares in the market, shorts must buy 127M shares to reduce their short position. Of those 127M shares, if any are \"re-traded\" then the short position nets to zero and remains open (someone else takes the position.)\n\nOn a firm by firm basis, if you have a short position, when you rebuy shares, they either go back to who you lent it from (the borrower), or they close an IOU (a naked short position, which is like borrowing from the future or borrowing something that doesn't exist).\n\nIn the former case, the borrower can then sell you their shares (now shorties are buying twice) so you can cover other borrowed shares or naked short positions. But in the latter case, the share isn't being returned: it's closing out an IOU position. That share simply disappears from the market.\n\n**The important part is that at a firm level, you can close out short positions with synthetic shares, but on a macro level, using fake shares simply shifts the short debt to another firm (whoever sold the naked shares). So on a market level, it nets to zero.**\n\nThe theory is that if retail has over 100% ownership of GME, theoretically if no one sold, shorts could never close out all their positions. Shorts can buy from institutions, but after all that buying, if retail owns 150% of GME shares, they can't close the remaining 50% of excess, because they've already exhausted the institutions and insiders.\n\nIs this the case? We don't know, but the higher the SI%, the lower the tradeable float, and if 74M shares simply cease to trade, then the tradeable float, for all intents and purposes, is zero. At that point, they're simply closing IOUs in the aggregate, (buying them back) from anyone who sells.\n\nThe ideal situation however isn't having only 1M over the max shares locked, but more. Shorts will have to get close to 73M shares remaining in the market when all is said and done, so if diamond hands can even secure 50M shares, it makes the squeeze last a lot longer. If diamond hands secure over 73M shares, it means it's impossible to close the position, so they'll need to keep offering higher prices to convince people to sell. If diamond hands have over 100M shares, it's going to cost a lot of money to convince them to sell.\n\nThe more we hold, the more leverage we have over the price. No single party will be able to dictate price, but if retail holds the majority of GME, then when the squeeze comes, retail will have the majority of leverage (as long as the GME SI% is high enough).\n\nIf GME SI% is only 100%, and therefore retail only owns a small portion, we're going to have very minimal leverage. But if GME SI% is several hundred percent, and we hold 50M-100M+ shares, we gain incredible leverage.\n\nIt's not the same leverage as if an institution were to have that much ownership over a company because we're many different individuals, but it is significant leverage nonetheless.\n\nThis is not financial advice, credit to [\/u\/Gwaak](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Gwaak\/)","answer":"OP is being cautious. I'm in the camp there are 5-10 copies all outstanding shares not just the float out there. We have no idea though but that means they have to buy 5-10 to recreate a real share to give back.  \n\nThey dug a hole they can't get out of and they have created an army that will turn that hole into their tomb."}

{"question":"I've seen a lot of posts in the last few days, accusing Britain of stealing $45 trillion of India's wealth. How rich was India that it had so much and how did the British manage it nevertheless? For example.\n\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/OutOfTheLoop\/comments\/x9btdc\/whats_up_with_black_twitter_celebrating_queen\/innq96h\/\n\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/interestingasfuck\/comments\/xaekvs\/during_the_british_rule_of_india_from_1769_to\/\n\nI also get [this](https:\/\/mronline.org\/2019\/01\/15\/britain-robbed-india-of-45-trillion-thence-1-8-billion-indians-died-from-deprivation\/) article accusing not only Britain of stealing almost $50 trillion but also killing 1.8 *billion* Indians.\n\nLastly, a [master's thesis](https:\/\/www.diva-portal.org\/smash\/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1590981&amp;dswid=-5913) from Linnaeus University in Sweden, states\n\n&gt; British economic exploitation of Indian society is visible in the dreadful death toll from famine. Emeritus professor Utsa Patnaik estimated under the British regime, about **1. 6 trillion people had died.**\n\nWould like to know how far these large numbers are true.","answer":"I was trying to track down the original article by Utsa Patnaik but I couldn't find it. Part of where that $50 trillion comes from is the \"compounding at 5%\" assumption. 5% is a very high interest rate over 250 years - \u00a31 in 1772 compounded forward at 5% becomes nearly \u00a3200,000 in 2022. If you only adjusted for UK inflation, which averaged 1.9% over the last 250 years, \u00a31 in 1772 only becomes about \u00a3100 in 2022. To try and make sense of the influence of that we can look at the average flow of transfers per year between 1765 and 1938 that you'd need to get to $45 trillion with compounding to the present day at 5%; [I calculate that as $9 million per year](https:\/\/www.wolframalpha.com\/input?i=%2845*10%5E12%29%2F%28%5Csum_%7Bx%3D80%7D%5E%7B253%7D+1.05%5Ex%29), which is still a large sum, but if you change the compounding rate to 2% you instead get a total of $69 billion - almost a thousand times less than the figure Patnaik suggests. So the compounding assumption makes a big difference to the total figure.\n\nStill, is a flow of $9 million a year accurate? It's certainly true that there was a good deal of direct wealth extraction by British people from India, with a minority of British people involved with the East India Company getting filthy rich at the expense of Indians, to say nothing of the direct human rights atrocities and murder (William Dalrymple and Anita Anand's ongoing *Empire* podcast has some vivid details about what the British did in India). But there's a specific figure claimed here. Patnaik seems to equate \"drain\" with India's export surplus. Usually, exports are not a drain on a country because the countries that import the goods have to pay for them with something. The argument Patnaik makes is that the colonial setup allowed the British effectively to get exports from India without paying anything for them, so that the total value of the exports was all drained from India. Whether that's true is both an economic and a historical claim, and I don't know enough about the history to evaluate it. But [this comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/gc3ifr\/utsa_patnaik_claims_that_the_british_siphoned_45\/fp9yyx0\/) on \/r\/AskHistorians argues against the claim that all exports from India constituted drain, which would imply Patnaik is also overstating the flow of resources from India.\n\nThe 1.6 trillion people died figure is surely a typo for billion, a trillion is simply not a possible figure and it's not claimed by the other sources. The 1.8 billion deaths figure [seems to come from assuming](https:\/\/countercurrents.org\/polya201111.htm) that if the British had not ruled India, the annual death rate for India over the entire period would be 11 per 1000, which is the death rate of the US in the early 1920s; this doesn't seem like a remotely plausible assumption to me, but I'm no more a demographer than I am a historian.\n\nFinally, drain isn't necessarily the only way that Britain impoverished India. Acemoglu and Robinson have a lot of work on the importance of institutions in determining how fast a country grows. When the British were in India they set up institutions that were predominately extractive, aimed at taking wealth from the country rather than improving the lives of the people living there. Bad institutions can have persistent effects even after the British left, and may well have made India poorer by inhibiting its growth without actually making Britain commensurately richer."}

{"question":"Why are people still buying ZIP? Genuine question, as the title suggests. Burning your cash is easier and provides warmth. More uses than what this piece of shit stock offers. Still baffles me seeing large amounts of buy offers.","answer":"There are several reasons that I think Zip is worth buying:\n\nFirstly, I think they are growing quickly and already have a large customer base (approx 11 million+), and given the number of regions they are in I expect this to grow nicely over the next 5 years.\n\nSecondly, once you have a large customer base you can then leverage that to make a profit. They can provide additional products to that customer base to diversify\/create additional revenue streams - for example they can release savings accounts, share trading, crypto trading etc.\n\nIn addition, I think they provide a lot of value to merchants - increased sales\/conversion rates, access to a larger customer base etc. They can also obtain revenue via the merchants through transaction fees, advertising fees etc.\n\nThey are also obtaining a lot of data on their customers - e.g. average spend, types of spend, what products they like etc. This is very valuable and can be utilised to increase revenue long term.\n\nI think there is a growing trend of disliking credit cards, and so BNPL offers an alternate form of credit that I believe will be trendier\/more appealing to future generations.\n\nI also believe their business lending component is innovative and appealing to a lot of SMEs, and has a lot of room for growth.\n\nBNPL currently accounts for only a fraction of all spending, and reports indicate this will continue to grow significantly over the next 5-10 years.\n\nI'm not at all concerned about the rising interest rates - I think it is over hyped and as covid\/supply chains resolve these will naturally settle down. And even if they increase significantly, several BNPLs have indicated that the cost of borrowing is a fraction of their operating costs and won't be a problem. Also there is a good chance that as interest rates rise customers are going to utilise BNPL more to help with their spending\/saving etc.\n\nThe biggest concern for Zip is bad debts - but I think that as they continue to grow and remove the customers that don't pay the bad debts will naturally be reduced as a percentage of total transaction value. Zip can tighten\/loosen their credit lending criteria on a daily basis if they wish until they achieve their target level of bad debts.\n\nIn addition, the largest takeover\/purchase of an Australian company ever was Afterpay - a BNPL company. We have seen banks and other fintech companies like Paypal enter the space - if it wasn't worth entering they wouldn't be doing it. Paypal also acquired a different BNPL for a high valuation as well from memory. \n\nZip is a global player with lots of room for growth - and if you compare its valuation to similar size competitors (or competitors that are slightly larger) like Affirm - the competitors are valued at more than 10x what Zip is. If that doesn't indicate room for the share price to grow I don't know what will.\n\nIt's a long term play, but one I think will pay off very nicely in the next 5-10 years."}

So when your friend cleans your house, there is one more service being produced that satisfies your preference to have your house cleaned. The fact that the amount of money inside Sweden stays the same is besides the point. Fundamentally, we don't care about pieces of paper, we care about our wants and needs being satisfied. Real GDP is a good measure of economic growth because it represents this increase in production. If we focused just on there being as much money as possible, we could just print more money, but what are you going to do with that money if there is no more goods and services to buy? That's just going to lead to inflation. So, focus on the production of useful things, not on money per se."}
{"question":"What are examples where unionization ruined a business, or all members become worse off afterwards?

How should I not fuck up the business that I rely on for my wage?","answer":"A union would never destroy the company their members work for as it would not be rational for them to destroy their own jobs.\n\nIn economics we model unions as determining or negotiating the wage of all workers in a firm simultaneously instead of individual wage negotiations. This can never be bad for the workers as the union's objective is to maximise the economic surplus of all workers. \n\nThe people for which this is not optimal are people who potential could work for the firm but currently aren't; the unemployed. As wages are higher, new jobs become less profitable to firms and fewer jobs will be created. Employment protections negotiated by the union can have a similar effect. We call this the insider outsider theory of unemployment.\n\nWhat's certain is that unions will hurt firm profits as bargaining power in wage negotiation shifts towards the workers. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as in perfect competition firms should make zero (economic) profits anyway. So if all markets were perfectly competitive, unionization wouldn't make a difference.\n\nIt can therefore be argued that unions lead to a second best solution where the bargaining power of one employer is countered by the  bargaining power of one union representing all employees.\n\nEdit: Btw, very good question!"}
{"question":"How to determine the target price for a stock using P\/E ratio? I listen to the various pundits on CNBC every day talking about stocks and they'll often say, \"I think stock X is over-valued and I'm waiting for it to pull back to $Y.\"  Now sometimes they'll base that on the technicals for the stock but other times they seem to imply that their target is based on valuation.  What I'm trying to figure out is some rule of thumb for coming up with a rough target price for a stock using the stock's P\/E ratio.  For example, I'm might try to estimate an entry price by going to eTrade, looking at the annual earnings for the stock, eyeballing the P\/E Trends chart for a stock to figure out what an average P\/E for the last year was, and then multiplying that P\/E by the annual earnings to come up with a price.  Is this a reasonable way to try to figure out the target price for a stock?  And should I be using the annual TTM earnings (i.e. the earnings for all of 2019)?  Sorry if this sounds like a stupid question.  I'm obviously a novice.\n\nAlso, is this the right subreddit to ask question on evaluating a stock or are there more suitable subs to ask my questions on?  I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask questions since the bias is towards value investing and I'm more interested in analyzing growth stocks.","answer":"P\/E is no where close to being an indicator of a fair value of the business (or in your approach - price). P\/E just shows how much investors are willing to pay for a $1 earned by the business. That ration could be low due to overall sector (ex. utilities), due to market sentiment towards the business and other things. \nYou can look at the company's historical P\/E, as well as compare it to industry's PE to see where the company stands in comparison to its peers, but there is more work to do to evaluate the fair value of the business.

Coupling it with the pivot points, if the same trend continues today and tomorrow we'll see a breakout and support lines forming around $215+*\n\n**Disclaimer: My predictions are just me speculating and do not necessarily mean they are right. The increased volatility with low float means the price could go in any directions. But the indicators seem to be showing a healthy direction for a bullish market.**\n\n**Now comparing this to the RSI before January squeeze:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[RSI before jan squeeze](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8otntoxum0m61.jpg?width=455&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fda45bc0fd98a78cea2e04d90c88ed9187a36d91)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRSI Value: 72.14\n\nAs seen from the second image, RSI trend before the breakout was in an uptrend. However, the slope was not as steep as we're currently seeing right now and when the price really started getting high, RSI showed a massive overbought. Comparing this back to the march RSI, that trend is still in the neutral territory and has potential for a more violent uptick as RSI value reaches the 70-75+ region.\n\n# Volume Weighted Average Price\n\nThe volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price security has traded throughout the day, based on both volume and price.\u00a0*It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of security.* Large institutional buyers and mutual funds use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. **This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.**\n\n*VWAP calculates the sum of price multiplied by volume, divided by total volume.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[VWAP January 13th-22nd](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jcps124xm0m61.jpg?width=131&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67dbb4877f7fa69b17429839bfa967c605d2b08d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[VWAP March 1st-8th](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s2sqhq2ym0m61.jpg?width=324&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2916f02390c863ea8b815eaca847d618766f51e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Blue Line indicates the volume-weighted average price. **Comparing both pictures, the vwap value in regards to each candlestick seems to show the same pattern.**\n* VWAP has been above the average day trading price between 6 and 7th March, this seems to act like the support line for the price.\n* **8th march and 22nd January show a similar pattern, both had a relatively significant increase in (=increased volatility and more violent price swings) as well as a positive slope gradient.**\n\n# Moving Average Convergence Divergence\n\nMACD is a trend-following [momentum](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/momentum.asp) indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security\u2019s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period [exponential moving average](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/ema.asp) (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the \"signal line,\" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. **Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MACD january](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/akhuo1g1n0m61.jpg?width=311&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32ae04bfcde02eb35d592de58a87f48053cda122)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MACD march](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l0cu7ez2n0m61.jpg?width=553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b836600d1bb2bac2c97aa6a10a97607381532f8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) which graphs the distance between the MACD and its signal line. If the MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD\u2019s baseline.\n\n* **MACD in January showed a gradual increase till breakout, the march macd value is much stronger in regards to the trend and can see the signal line deviating away from the EM**A. Linking it back to the RSI uptrend, trend seems to be bullish and does not show any signs of divergence. *Outcome? Will probably continue this trend for the days to come*\n\n# Other Indicators\n\nSince I ran out of time and probably you apes have ran out of patience as well, I'm just going to list the other moving averages indications to summarise the trends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Indicator Values taken from trading view](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dt8dgbo4n0m61.jpg?width=663&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=178b8def7cf54223bb626d78f7be1187159e0bd4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TLDR\n\n**Most (If not all) Moving average indicators show a very strong bullish market on a DAY scale as we can see the trend to continue to follow an uptrend. The Resistance level 3 pivot points may become the new support live if the RSI+MACD trend continues. Neither show divergence which is also a good sign.**\n\nAnyways hope I've cleared some things out, and if the DD needs correction then please feel free to let me know so i can fix\/include the data. **This is my last DD to the series and hope it has benefited people, I'll be taking some time off now to snort coke,** ***bon voyage*** **apes!**\n\n\\*Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving financial advice.

{"question":"NASA: Not Another Shit Altcoin | 10+ Successful Rug Pull Relief Fund Applicants So Far | YouTube Video Review Released | Multiple Use Cases | Low Market Cap Gem \ud83d\udc8e **This is why we do what we do:**\n\n\"WindSwap was one of my first crypto investments - given the success of other altcoins and the seemingly legit project, I invested money into the project. A few days ago the entire project was rugged - the website and all social media were deleted. I just had a kid earlier this year and I have been trying to identify legit projects to invest in in order to give her a better future than I had. While I only invested what I could afford to lose, it still hurts to see this blatant scam. I invested in NASA about a month ago, and so far have been extremely happy with the efforts of the team. I just found out about the Rug relief fund this week, and given my recent loss, I'd very much appreciate consideration for the relief fund.\u201d\n\nApplications for NASA Token\u2019s Rug Pull Relief Fund are increasing everyday, and as a result, so does the amount of successful applicants. At this current point in time, NASA has received 20 applications and have approved more than half of them. Not only does this emphase the high success rate of applicants but it also demonstrates how NASA is not afraid to give out free tokens providing investors meet the criteria.\n\nIn addition to this, NASA has teamed up with Crypto Bull to bring you the first (of many) YouTube video reviews on the NASA Token. Crypto Bull, while not extremely popular, puts a lot of effort and thought into his reviews, which made partnering with him an easy decision. Make sure you check it out here https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6jaK-mpErV4.\n\nThe Rug Pull Relief Fund is only ONE of NASA\u2019s number of use cases, the others include:\n\n* **NFT\u2019s**. Over the past week NASA has secured a partnership with a juggernaut of the cryptospace, CumRocket. Keep an eye out for the official release of the NFT - this will be HUGE.\n* **NASA Auditing Service**. NASA is on the cusp of releasing the report of their first audited token. The auditing service will also tie in with the NFT marketplace they are currently in the process of developing.\n* **NASA\u2019s \u201cTop Secret\u201d App**. An exclusive app for hodlers of the NASA Token, which will also give direct access to NASA\u2019s many services it provides.\n\nNASA\u2019s chart is looking incredibly healthy and bullish. Despite the market dips, despite the constant FUD and the naysayers calling NASA \u201cjust another shitcoin\u201d the team has remained resilient and united. They have worked tirelessly around the clock, innovating and developing NASA to ensure its future success.\n\nThe world is slowly starting to recognize what the team at NASA have known since the very beginning, which is that NASA is Not.

{"question":"Am I being scammed? Hello, I hope this is the right place to post this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI recently found myself in a rather strange situation.  A few weeks ago, I was walking around with my girlfriend in a shopping mall.  A lady who looked in her late 30's early 40's approached us and complemented my girlfriend's new heels she was wearing.  The conversation opened up, and we ended up talking for a while.  She asked us what we both do for a living.  I told her that I recently graduated college (I am 23) with a business degree in Marketing, and that I am currently inbetween jobs, as I recently got out of a job working for my father's business for 6 months.  I told her that my aim was to be self-employed one day.  She said that I should talk to her husband as he could potentially have work for me, and asked for my number so he could reach me.  In my head I said fuck it why not, and we exchanged numbers.  It seemed ordinary enough, and I believe the woman had her kids with her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAbout a week passes and the husband texts me referencing that I spoke to his wife for a bit and he asked for a good time to chat on the phone.  A week later we talked on the phone, and he asked if I would like to meet up for a coffee to talk for a little bit after I finished working at my part time job.  I said sure, didn't seem like it would hurt.  So last night after I got out of my shift, I met him at the closest Starbucks, and both him and his wife that I met prior were there.  They were dressed nice.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe exchange was a mock interview of some sorts, but I still do not know what exactly it is they do.  They asked me some general questions, and asked me what kind of a person I am.  They asked if I am \"process oriented\" or \"outcome oriented\".  The husband said he had a mentor when he was younger and now he is \"financially independent\".  They asked what I am passionate about, and if I am a \"free thinker\".  They asked about my hobbies and interests so I told them how I played sports for a while.  The husband also said he has a son that plays football at a private school - a school that I have definitely heard of.  They seemed to be fairly well-off.  Then they gave me a book to read called, \"The Business of the 21st Century\" by Robert T. Kiyosaki.  They asked me to read this book and that we are going to talk about it at our next meeting on Monday.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat should I make of all of this?  This entire exchange has been quite strange, but I have no direct evidence that leads me to the conclusion that this is indeed a scam.  They seem like nice people but I'm really not sure where this is going.  Does anyone know what this is?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks in advance, I know this was kind of a long post.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUPDATE: Wow, this blew up.  I appreciate all the responses.  I really have no interest in going to the next meet-up, even knowing that it is a scam.  It is kind of upsetting because I recently got fired and am looking for something to get me back on track.  My personality does not suit Network marketing so I know it would be a waste of time and money - to the commenters below that said that it works for certain people.  Also, some comments have been patronizing me for not being aware of it being a scam from the start.  I didn't end up spending any money, did I?  God, some people are just insanely judgmental.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo those that said for me to keep my chin up and help put things into perspective, your comments have been very helpful.

This book lends credibility to multilevel marketing business, and justifies why it is an ideal avenue to make money.\"\n\n\nThey may be nice people, but to me it sounds like they are trying to reel you in by getting to know you, planting a seed in your brain by having you read this book and then at your next meeting they are going to try and pitch you some product (maybe even the book?) to sell\/ recruit people to sell. \n\n\n&gt;I still don't know what exactly it is they do.\n\n\nI think this kind of answers it.

{"question":"For Someone who is absolutely at level Zero in terms of Money Management [New to Investing] - Part 4 How to go about putting the money which has been allocated for savings\/investing?\n\nHow to decide how much to put where?\n\nWe will create two categories or my preferential term Baskets (or Buckets).\n\n**Basket 1:** Money which can be needed in next 5-7 years\n\n**Basket 2:** Money which is needed after 5-7 years.\n\n**Why 5 years?** Because that is the cycle of our national elections! Just kidding. It is just an arbitrary number but 5-7 years is a reasonable. If you like 7 years, keep it 7. *Like my username is 7 letters long, so I can keep it 7 years!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Basket 1\n\nAim: money which is needed within 7 years. \n\nWhat to use: Franklin Corporate Debt fund \u2013 Direct option. Why: well diversified. Excellent management team. Expected rate of interest is around 8-9% per year but it would fluctuate. However, over 3-4 years, it should stabilize in that range. My own return in this fund till date (since 8 years) is 8.13%.\n\n# Basket 2\n\nAim: money which is needed at least after 7 years. \n\nWhat to use: Now this is a little more complicated, so we will go **step-by-step**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart A: Some terms explanation needed first (The whole post is [Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IndiaInvestments\/comments\/2umjqg\/investing_reframed_eli5_series\/)). I have put it here again, because I fear that a link may be distracting.\n\n**Cash** \\- The money is with you physically. The closest equivalent is a Current \/ Savings account in a bank.\n\n**Bonds -** You are giving your cash to someone who will provide you regular payouts at fixed intervals and give you back a predecided lumpsum at the end of the period. Sometimes, you can skip the payouts and ask for them to be given at the end of the period only (eg, compounded growth option of fixed deposits or bonds). So, when you invest Rs 1000 in a 9% FD for 1 year , you are basically giving 1000 now with the promise that the bank will give you 1090 at the end of 1 year.\n\nDepending upon the quality and return-back capability of that someone, the net lumpsum and payouts vary. So, a govt backed bank \/ agency will give you a lower lumpsum with a very higher degree of probability that it will return you the money than a small private business.\n\nStocks\/Equities (=something related to Sensex\/Nifty) - You are giving cash to someone to hand over to you a part of a company so that you can get the payments (called dividends) declared by the company. There are no guarantees of the amount or the interval of these payments. There is no fixed time interval or a lumpsum at the end of a time period (effectively holding period is infinite).\n\nTo assess these payments, a higher level of understanding is required (higher as compared to above options) to assess the quality and probability of the company to provide those payouts in the future.\n\nPart B:\n\nFor long term money (&gt;7 years in this case), we will keep money in two parts, so two parts within Basket 2. These parts are Bond\/Fixed income and Equity. And we need to decide on the amount of split between the two groups.\n\nThe simplest way to divide between the two groups is an equal division also called as 50:50. Divide equally and that is it. No calculations needed. Easy, simple and quite optimum.\n\nThe amount labeled as Basket 2 can be put into the following funds:\n\n1. Fixed income group: Franklin Income Opportunities fund \u2013 Direct option.  Similar fund to basket 1 fund but a different name and character.\n2. Equity group: After lot of pondering, I have zeroed on PPFAS LTE fund \u2013 Direct option. Excellent ethics. Good team. International diversification is a uniqueness, which I wholeheartedly agree. Good customer support.\n\n**An example** of how will go about.\n\nIncome = 50,000 a month (easier to calculate things that way). Savings amount = 25,000 a month (50% target rate).\n\nSince, we haven\u2019t really done any major calculations regarding money needed within 7 years, and money needed beyond 7 years, we can start with again a split of 50:50 between baskets 1 and 2.\n\nBasket 1: Franklin Corporate Debt fund \u2013 direct option = allot 12,500 per month.\n\nBasket 2: Franklin income opportunities fund \u2013 direct option = allot 6,250 per month.PPFAS LTE fund \u2013 direct option = allot 6,250 per month.\n\nMore terms:\n\n**SIP (systematic investment plan)** \u2013 this is a way to invest a fixed amount of money on a particular date periodically. They can be applied to any mutual fund, and is not applicable only to equity funds. They can be started for the all the above 3 funds.\n\nMutual Fund \u2013 please [refer to this post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IndiaInvestments\/comments\/2nh30p\/mutual_fund_eli5_series\/).\n\n**More Questions:**\n\n1. How long to continue the above combination? For 3-4 years at the least. Ideally 5 years.\n2. Should I increase the money when I get a raise next time? Of course. When your income rises to say 60,000 then increase the amounts to 15,000; 7,500 and 7,500 per month.\n3. Which date should I put the SIP date on? Put it 7 days after your normal salary day. So, if you receive your salary on 1st, then put SIP on 7th. Why? Because sometimes the salary gets delayed, and then your SIP will get skipped. Don\u2019t worry, they will not charge you money for that skipping.\n4. Why equal divisions? I am smart enough to calculate the exact ratios. Well, if this series has woken you up to that level of smartness, indeed do those calculations but do start investing within this month onwards, rather than doing all those calculations only. Stop the action paralysis and get a decent start NOW. Rather than an optimum start some months\/years down the line.\n5. Why these funds only and not any other? Because I am saying these funds are good enough for long term holding. I have personal experience with each of them. Pattu can vouch for them as well.\n6. What if I need to plan out 80C investment also? Opt for Franklin india taxshield and use it for complete usage of 80C limit.\n\n**To summarise the approach (across 4 posts):**\n\n1. Have 1 bank account with netbanking enabled.\n2. Keep some amount of money in that account, while rest of the money should be moved to a liquid fund. Or FD, if the tax rate is less for you (10% bracket max.).\n3. Get a health insurance, if not done yet.\n4. Get a life insurance.\n5. Do less spending.\n6. Don\u2019t get a credit card. Have a debit card and use cash.\n7. Target a savings amount (50%, 30%, 10%, whatever and gradually either increase that or increase income and keep that ratio intact).\n8. Put 3 SIPs, 7 days after salary credit into account, for the relevant amounts.\n9. Do this for next 3-5 years.\n\nPing me after 5 years for what to do next!!\n\n**Addendum:**\n\nWhy such a plan combination? This is for those who want to know more intricacies of the choices.\n\n1. We have got 3 debt funds and 1 equity fund, across 2 AMCs. Much easier to start and manage. Eventually, when there will need for switches between these funds, then it remains easy.\n2. They can be either 3 Franklin funds and 1 PPFAS fund or 2 Franklin funds and 2 PPFAS funds. The ethics of both the AMCs is top notch. There are other funds who may have funds with better returns, but I don\u2019t trust them (read ICICI and HDFC) as much as I do these 2 AMCs.\n3. The debt management team of Franklin Templeton is top-notch. There will always be problems like IL&amp;FS recently and JSPL in the past (in the latter, Franklin\u2019s funds suffered a permanent loss), but this is where diversification helps.\n4. All the funds are either well diversified or invest in high rated papers. And the expense ratios of these funds are on the lower side (whatever they are charging is giving real value).\n5. Till 1-2 crores of amounts, I don\u2019t see any real need to have more funds than these.\n6. Why the choice of Franklin Taxshield for 80C? because it is better to have a decent good choice of taxsaver and currently out of the two recommended AMCs, only 1 has a tax saver.\n7. I don't like PPFAS fund, since I have not heard about them. Can you suggest another fund? Reluctantly, Franklin Bluechip fund - direct option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IndiaInvestments\/comments\/9ltgni\/for_someone_who_is_absolutely_at_level_zero_in\/), [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IndiaInvestments\/comments\/9lusap\/for_someone_who_is_absolutely_at_level_zero_in\/) and [Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IndiaInvestments\/comments\/9lyeye\/for_someone_who_is_absolutely_at_level_zero_in\/)","answer":"Thanks for the write-up. It's really helpful. \n\nA few follow-up questions:\n\n1) You've allocated 50-50 in the second basket. If someone hypothetically wanted to change this allocation, what factors would affect the change ?\n\n2) If someone already had a reasonable corpus (read Lakhs) saved, is SIP still the best way to move it from FD (or liquid fund based on your post 1) to these MFs ? How should one determine the duration over which such a move should be spread ? Doing it in one shot feels like there is a need to \"time\" the move to market movements properly. \n\n3) The confidence you have in the management teams seems to be a major factor in your choice of funds. How did you go about understanding the management teams of these funds (Franklin\/PPFAS). Maybe I've misunderstood things, but in this sub-reddit itself, I've seen some comments to the effect that Franklin Bluechip used to be great, but has not been so great over the last 3-4 years due to internal changes.

{"question":"Want to aggressively grow your account? Learn to save. With investing, there is a direct correlation between risk and reward. If we want to increase our reward, we increase our risk whether you realize it or not. Most of the accounts I see on this thread fall below $100k (based on a survey I did a month or so ago) with the majority under $25k. \n\nTrading in a smaller account is a completely legitimate endeavor and helps refine a lifelong skill set. The danger comes in when one expects to take that $15K account and turn it into $100k, $50K or even $25K. When I first started, I had $5K and was expecting to turn it into $20K in a couple years and naively thought that was completely reasonable. Luckily, I had a couple hard conversations, of which I didn\u2019t believe at first, that ultimately reshaped my perception of reality. \n\nHaving aspirations is great. Creating targets and goals is important. Attempting to turn a small account into your source of wealth is not so great. More likely than not, it will include taking outsized risk that will sooner or later catch you. \n\nThe best possible way to aggressively grow your account (IMO) is to continue trading, being sure to remain profitable - when smaller accounts lose money it can have exponential negative effects years ahead. Learn to earn a consistent return, ideally topping SP500 performance (if you don\u2019t after 4-5 years, consider switching to buy and hold or move a sizable portion). SAVE your money. Continue developing additional streams of income. \n\nThis grind in your early 20s can pay off as early as your late 20s. I was blown away when I realized I surpassed my goal to cover all living expenses with my investing account at late 27. Much was luck in making the right moves in other ventures at the right time. The point remains. If you can aggressively save your money to boost your account value, then achieve consistent market beating returns, spread into other ventures (real estate, business development, etc) you will be surprised how fast wealth begins to accumulate. \n\nNone of this eludes in any capacity that this is easy. I spent the better part of a decade planning, committing, and refining this. However, if we apply ourselves and develop a plan, we can greatly increase our propensity for success. I come from a lower middle class single mother that was a over her head in debt. My graduating class had over 800 kids in a poor urban town. By all accounts I am average. That\u2019s the beauty of investing, we don\u2019t need to to be extraordinary to get started. We do need to develop the craft to become a statistical outlier - but it\u2019s entirely possible.","answer":"Wait a minute...

As long as you're nowhere near 0.1%+ of total volume in terms of your trades, is there any disadvantage from making it open source ?\n\nPresumably the more people use the strategy the better your results, even if you get no code contributions, since the more people use your algorithm the more the market moves in a direction that's favorable to it.\n\nI guess it might fail in various niches (e.g. a FFT algorithm doesn't work if multiple people are trying to whale the same large transactions before they happen), but overall it seems like it's a net benefit to open source the algorithm.\n\nThought on this subject ?","answer":"&gt; Presumably the more people use the strategy the better your results, even if you get no code contributions, since the more people use your algorithm the more the market moves in a direction that's favorable to it.\n\nIn general, this isn't how it works (although it is a common misconception). For a toy example, suppose your algo identifies when someone is selling a dollar bill for $0.99. You might think that giving it out to more people would make it converge faster to $1 (and this is probably true in the very short term). Although, realistically then you have to think about why you aren't trying to scale it yourself and instead are giving away your profits to other people.\n\nHowever, someone will realize that for the next time rather than competing with 1000 other people to get a fill at .99, it is better to buy sooner at .991. Other people may try buying at .992, .993, etc. Eventually the alpha will completely go away, as any time the price of a dollar goes below $1, someone will buy it!"}

I don\u2019t get why there is so much hate against Afterpay and it\u2019s for people who can\u2019t afford\/ poor people and etc. \n\nI use Afterpay for my most of my large purchases and it doesn\u2019t cost me any extra, I always pay within the 4-5 fortnight. It helps me with my cash flow and I can put a fixed sum into my savings every week and cut back on future discretionary spending to make the repayments.

{"question":"Grandparents gifted me &amp; S\/O 100g of 99.99% gold to start a college fund, since we are expecting a baby.

Thanks!\n\nEdit: wow this blew up! Thanks y'all. To clarify a few things: yes my grandparents are Chinese, but no they don't care about the gold bar remaining physically gold. They're much more interested in the grandkid becoming a doctor, so if reinvesting the gold bar helps that, they're fully on board :) ","answer":"There will be plenty of money later to start a college fund. \n\nMy opinion is that when your baby is born, take a photo with your grandparents and the baby with the gift. \n\nThat will definitely be a keepsake, of their legacy to your child.  \n\nAnd then 18 years later you can have your child receive the gift. By then you'll already have a college fund and can decide to add to it with the gold bar, or use that money towards a car.\nOr at that point, you and your child can decide to just hold onto it.\n\nBtw, there's something special about receiving a gift from a family member when one matures.  ;-)"}

{"question":"1 Year in, Still Haven't Figured it Out  Hey y'all, just looking for some advice. I've been trying to teach myself trading for over a year now, and I have still yet to find a solid strategy to implement. I hear people talk a lot about price action, and that it's really the only way to be profitable, but is this true?\n\nI had, what is probably pretty similar to a lot of people, stagnant year, or what feels like one. I've tested quite a few strategies, with almost no consistency, I've come to find that MOST indicators either lag behind too much or give too many false signals to be reliable. However, I have found that VWAP and an solid EMA can help a lot.\n\nThroughout this year I've tried to get funded with Topstep, and I spent probably 5-6 months doing so, got really close two times to passing the first steps (I'm talking about $30 in profit to pass and I had made $8,900 in simulated profits) just to get smacked down.\n\nWhile I'm still getting my emotions in check (which I know is a HUGE part of trade) I still can't help feel like I'm missing something. I know a cleaner chat, one with fewer indicators is better, but I've yet to find a consistent strategy.\n\nDid any of y'all go through this roadblock? What helped you? Who do watch on youtube that helped you learn concepts that propelled you forward? What strategies do you implement? Anything will help! Thanks y'all!\n\nFYI: I mainly trade NQ, mainly try to scalp, trading solely on the 1,3, or 5 minute time frame.","answer":"A lot can be said here -\n\nPersonally I would start was ES as it\u2019s less volatile and a bit cleaner. I personally trade NQ and love it however if i were to start again I would try to learn on ES because I could manage risk better. More often than not a 2-3 point stop on ES as a scalper is good and that\u2019s $100-$150. With NQ during RTH in my opinion a 15 point stop is almost mandatory to avoid constant paper cuts. \n\nI would also stay way way way away from the 1\/3 minute while learning. Patterns tend to follow through more on longer time frames. I think 15 minute is optimal for learning \n\nYour spot on with indicators. Price action and volume is really key with futures. VWAP (which is really just a visual representation of price and volume). Also in my opinion volume profiles are HUGE with futures. I have the daily volume profile on the chart I\u2019m trading. I also use weekly, monthly, and even yearly volume profiles on much longer time frames (think 4 hour, 8 hour, daily, weekly)\n\nIn my opinion beginners get caught up with what\u2019s happening on short time frames without realizing the big picture. You want to use small time frames for entries based around larger pivots and important areas."}
{"question":"Has anyone on low income bought an investment property and made it work?

{"question":"Does \"rebalancing\" your portfolio always make you lose out on dividends? It seems like there is a certain amount of time you need to hold you stocks\/ETFs to get the next dividend.

{"question":"Reasons to NOT close trades at 21 DTE? I've been working to establish better trading rules for myself, and a little over a month ago, implemented TT's 45\/21 rule. I understand that past 21 days, volatility may very likely turn a profitable trade into a loss.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone here lets winning trades ride longer than this in certain circumstances. For example, if I have a vertical spread with 20 DTE that's at 90% profit already (I know this is against TT ways, but hear me out), I totally agree with closing it. However, I've found several times that a spread I open is at very favorable strikes, and that closing it and opening a new one on the same stock would easily put me at more risk. \n\nA recent example:\n\nI opened a 1100\/1105 bull put spread on TSLA a while ago with about a 65% POP. I forget the exact price I paid and other details, but the stock kept climbing as we all know. Around 21 DTE, TSLA was over $1400. While I understand there's still a risk it could go down and turn my trade into a loser, I felt like my spread was so far OTM that my chances of profit in holding it longer were very strong - much better than opening another 65% POP TSLA spread at, say, 1390\/1400. Holding my original spread longer could potentially double my profit, but opening that new spread could wipe out my gains and then some if TSLA takes a turn.\n\nAgain, I know there's definitely a time to take your winnings, but I feel it's not as concrete as pulling out at 21 DTE.\n\nWhat do you guys think?","answer":"TastyWorks says naked options get rolled at 21 days, but they also say that when you enter a spread you have defined your risk at a level you are comfortable with. There is no \"rule\" to close out a spread at 21 days - although you could roll a losing trade if you wanted to stay in the trade longer. You did hit their 50% price target, though, so if you're being mechanical you could close. Personally, if the strikes I am in are the same strikes I would choose for a new trade, is just stay in."}
{"question":"What is up with Ripple and Stellar Lumens compared to ETH? Their trading volume has been consistently way higher than ETH (polo) and I don't understand why so many people appear to be supporting these two cryptos which appear to be massively centralized (e.g. creators hold like 80% supply) and have a MUCH weaker value proposition than ETH.  \n\nAll these huge gains by so many altcoins makes me a little insecure about the gains that ETH has achieved.  I thought the rise was on the merit of ETH, but there appears to be so much stupid money flying around, maybe it's not.\n\nWhen will the money get smarter?  Or have I just drank too much kool-aid :)","answer":"Ripple is a settlement network. In that respect, it has 3 USP's to its partner banks that differentiate it from the existing settlement networks: more secure transactions, faster transactions (second versus days), and cheaper transactions. Ripple's track record so far includes partnerships with a lot of big and small banks and some small scale experimentation. e.g., BBVA sending fifty euros** only Spain to Mexico. For the potential Ripple has, it (i.e., the technology protocol \/ the company \/ the foundation) is valued at over $5bn. \n\nLet's just think about that for a second, in the real world.\n\nSWIFT, the world's leading financial settlement network, processes 100s of billions of transactions per year, making around EUR300m in traffic fees. Ripple claims it will cost as little as 80% of what SWIFT charges to transact. If you believe Ripple decimates SWIFT and takes all of its transactions, but at that price, it is 60m EUR revenue. About 1 in 4 euros earned by SWIFT (so about EUR200m) are consulting fees, because big interbank networks aren't easy to form, because big banks are slow movers, encumbered by legacy systems and bureaucracy. It'll probably take a fair bit of consulting revenue to upend a decades old workflow and systems, so maybe Ripple will make double what SWIFT do on consulting fees in the process (bold). So now we are at EUR460m revenue. If this were to be a highly profitable business, you might think, hmm, 20x EBIT multiple 'cus it is sexy, so a $5bn valuation seems punchy, but believable. SWIFT has an EBIT of &lt;10%. Over 50% OPEX is payroll expenses, and Ripple are also going to need an army to transform the payments. I am not finding a way to anything more than 120m EBIT at scale. You could argue a higher multiple, but 30x, 40x, and 50x work for SaaS startups with a shit-ton of market left to go after, which Ripple wouldn't have in this scenario.\n\nIn short, I just don't buy the valuation, so I'm not risking your money on it or my money on it at its current valuation.\n\nSam\n\n**this is &lt;0.00000000001% of global transactions"}

It is not fair to those two countries. And I think we have got to do something with this. We will never have those real conversations, but if we woke up tomorrow and every central bank in the world raised their interest rates by 300 basis points, the world would be a better place. No currency should move because all the relationships would be the same, but insurance companies would work, pensions would work, savers would work, we would get people out of bank-loan funds, we would get people out of bond funds and they could put their money back in banks and back in government bonds where it belongs.\u201d\n\nI don't understand the basics. \n\nIs he saying that because the US (and China) has strong currency that the rest of the world can lower their interest rates? \n\nIs he saying that the (more or less) world-wide low low interest rates are a big issue?

He's saying that because some currencies have to \"be strong\" for others to be devalued against, it's unfair to be the one not devaluing. This seems to me like a \"average libertarian blogroll\" level of understanding.\n\nThe US is a net importer. It is good for its import business to have a relatively strong currency. It's kind of a mercantilist and naive way to view the world that \"devaluing is cheating because everyone wants to export to everyone else\".

China!)\n\n&gt; Is he saying that the (more or less) world-wide low low interest rates are a big issue? If so, why? \n\nI think he's saying that we're in a prisonner's dilemma, eg. that central banks want to raise interest rates but can't because other central banks have low interest rates. He's thinking like a commercial banker, I think, here. Or perhaps, he's advocating the Fed to take a position that would help him in his commercial bank business, regardless of macroeconomics.\n\n&gt; Is he suggesting the FED should raise interest rates even if it screws up the rest of the world?\n\nI'm not sure.

Do it again tomorrow.\n\nThe market owes you nothing,  and will take EVERYTHING from you if you let it. Take your profits, be happy, and do it again tomorrow. Financial freedom WILL happen for you much quicker than you can imagine if you stay disciplined. \n\nAs you master this technique, you can find ways to maximize returns. You can incorporate your own little methods. But KEEP IT SIMPLE until its second nature to you. THEN you can make it a little more complex if you choose, in order to maximize consistent returns.\n\nI'll leave you with this example to better help you visualize:\n\n- You decide to hone in on SPX, and trade it exclusively. \n\n- You start with $100, on a cash account.\n\n- You've been practicing your indicators and watching it move. (SPX is basically just SPY x10, so you can watch SPY, and trade SPX based on this......its just easier to look at for me)\n\n- You see a setup. You execute. Boom, it breaks in your direction and you see 20% green on the trade. You sell. You just made $20 in 30 seconds to 10 minutes. \n\n$20 is not exciting, I get it. But look at it this way:\n\nIf you can consistently hit 20% green on your scalps, then here is how that compounds daily:\n\nDay 1: $100\nDay 2: $120\nDay 3: $144\nDay 4: $172\nDay 5: $206\n\nNext week\n\nDay 6: $247\nDay 7: $296\nDay 8: $355\nDay 9: $426\nDay 10: $511\n\nSee? It compounds. In 2 trading weeks, you've turned $100 into $500. All while spending less than an hour a day (usually) watching your stock move. \n\nBefore all the reddit gurus come in.......yes, im fully aware that it's not realistic to be right every time, and that the above example is a perfect two weeks worth of execution. This is just an example. The gist of it remains true. \n\n\"$100 to $500 you say? Well that still sucks.... I can't live on that.\"\n\nCrawl before you walk. Walk before you run. The above examples work whether you're using $100 trades or $1000 trades. If you can't execute a trade, and be profitable with $100......you won't be profitable with $1000 either. And it hurts alot more to be wrong with $1000 than it does with $100.\n\nWhat happens once you grow your portfolio a bit, and can justify $1000 per trade?\n\nExample: Immediately sell on a 10% move.\n\nTrading Day 1: $1000\nTrading day 10: $2591\n\nIn 2 weeks. This is also assuming you take 1 single trade each day. And manage to get it right for 2 weeks. The more you practice it, the more you'll be right.\n\nOf course this varies. Some days you'll be wrong and get stopped out. Some days it'll move fast in your direction, and instead of 10%, you'll be staring at 30%+ in minutes. (Especially with something like SPX). BUT, the concept remains the same. \n\n\nDon't overcomplicate this. It's a huge learning curve in the beginning, but once you get past this initial curve, and are comfortable looking at a chart, it does get much easier. \n\nWe can all eat. But the lazy, lottery playing, get rich in one trade crowd will starve to death eventually, and join in the statistic of the \"most day traders fail\" stigma. \n\nDon't be them. Learn the craft. Prosper."}

{"question":"Here's what's going on in South Korea concerning the Cryptocurrency Market: [xpost: \/r\/bitcoinmarkets] The Ministry of Justice here raided exchange to find any tax irregularities and also made a press release saying they are recommending the government ban cryptocurrency exchanges because they consider it gambling. They already tried a less stringent recommendation before, but the Korean Parliament voted it down because of constituent pressure. The reason the Ministry of Justice is doing this again is because so much capital is fleeing the Korean stock market and entering cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen Moon Jai-In became president, there was a lot of expectation for the Kospi and Kosdaq to do well even though he is what Koreans would consider a left wing politician. What they did not expect was the atomic bomb of crypto to explode among the youth and wealthy here. The politicians are getting very confusing signals from the public in how to deal with this because the public is very divided on this issue. The crypto market here is 70% made up of 20-30 year olds who believe this is the future. The very wealthy are seeing unbelievable gains even though they have strong ties to the real estate and stock market. Many others see this as a way of gambling and something that must be banned. All this diverging public outcry is leading to the elections this summer...\n\nIn a couple of months, there will be local elections and suddenly politicians find themselves having to take a stance in what is becoming the biggest social, economic issue Korea has faced in a long time. What makes this extremely interesting is that the pressure they feel from the wealthy families here who own the Korean companies is that even though their stocks are suffering, their crypto holdings are far outpacing those losses. Plus the majority of the young vote in Korea is very pro crypto, so they are not sure what stance to take.\n\nIf I had to make an educated guess what do I think will happen? They can try to slow it down, but they will have to accept its reality. Right now there is a ban on people making new accounts on the exchanges that is suppose to be lifted at the end of January, but they may try to extend this ban. Eventually they will lift it because the anger from denying the public access to this market will only grow endangering the politicians' careers who are supporting these types of bans. They cannot stop crypto in Korea. It is an overwhelming wave they cannot shore up.\n","answer":"People need to realize that Korea is a (more or less) western style democracy.  It isn't authoritarian one-party-rule China.  They can't just ban shit and expect it to PASS.  Politicians need to have support from their peeps and all of them have some cabbage in crypto..because crypto has more adoption in Korea than anywhere else in the world.  This will sort itself out without any sort of ban.  It will end up simply being tax enforcement which might cool the jets a bit...it won't stop anything."}
{"question":"Update: Talk to me about 4000 sq ft homes 2020, what a wild ride!  \n\nI recently picked up an old device and found it logged into this old alt account, which just over a year ago I used to ask for advice on the new (bigger) house I was buying. Figured I'd update!\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/fatFIRE\/comments\/cy21lm\/talk\\_to\\_me\\_about\\_4000\\_sq\\_ft\\_homes\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/fatFIRE\/comments\/cy21lm\/talk_to_me_about_4000_sq_ft_homes\/)\n\nObviously at the time, none of us were anticipating a global pandemic, but man, I gotta say this house was one of my better decisions, and the last year would have been so much harder if I hadn't taken the leap. My family is way happier here (outer suburbs), lifestyle wise. We're more relaxed, in better shape (with gyms closed, it's so much easier to exercise here on the local trails, plus we have enough room for a home gym), and we spent the whole socially-isolated summer floating happily in our awesome pool. Having your own pool is completely different from belonging to a club, even a nice a one - trust me. Even distance learning has been okay since all the kids have their own rooms and workspaces now.\n\nThe biggest concern was the commute, which has been completely irrelevant since March, but was manageable before that. An extra bonus: the amount for which we were able to rent our old house almost completely covers the new mortgage payment. Really the only serious letdown has been my wife's hopes that we would be entertaining a lot, but maybe next year... Generally, life is good.\n\nBig thanks to u\/[mograe](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/mograe\/) for the tip about DIYing the pool. I fired the service and it's been easy, kinda fun, and honestly I think I'm doing a better job than they did anyway. Utilities\/services here are expensive, but not more than we expected, and luckily neither my wife nor I have fancy tastes, so we furnished the extra space for less than $10K, plus maybe another $15K in minor updates when we moved it. And what with the WFH situation in the Bay Area, property values here have climbed a ton, and if we were to sell today we've easily make 20%. \n\nThanks for the reinforcement last year, guys. It's been great.","answer":"If we're talking about big houses how does a smart person go about furnishing a whole house at once? Closing around EOM, 3k sq foot. Costco? Wayfair? Interior designer?

It's too much of a risk to go ahead with this and if we can't find a buyer, the construction would drain us of all our money. I was going to post an ad to see if anyone would be interested to pay 6K deposit (vs 36K) so we'd each atleast get 2k of our original deposit. But we received a letter from the developer last night for settlement not after Feb. So I don't think this plan is going to work.\n\nThe sad thing is my friends have bought another plot with one of their friend (same arrangement as me) that they are going to settle. I've explained the risks to my friends but they are going to go ahead anyways. But it's none of my concern anyways. They are rich and I don't think this would hurt them.\n\nThe big problem I have now is I'm fearful of investing. I haven't told you all before but I lost 7K last year on bitcoins. My wife doesn't trust me with money anymore and she's not convinced of ETFs too. So I don't know what to do with my money other than to keep it in a HISA.\n\nIt's funny I decided to shell out 7k last year to my friend to invest in WANCHAIN even without knowing what a bitcoin is or what the hell that I'm supposed to do with that. I convinced my aunt (7K) and uncle (3K) to invest along me and invest they did. Good thing is atleast they are not mad at me for losing all their money but blame themselves for their greediness. My friend losing all his 10K doesn't comfort me though.\n\nI write in length because normally people write success stories but they don't tell in what and how they failed.

NO!** They could have used the shares to satisfy a different short position, to satisfy FTD, to delta hedge a call or the numbers could have dropped simply because shares were removed from being available to borrow.

{"question":"The tech narrative of Jio makes no sense. How is this related to investing?  Well if the narrative does  not make sense than the value of Jio Platforms and by extension RIL stock will not seem as rosy as what these PE firms are investing at.\n\nI am just amused how RIL has managed to rake in so much money during such an economic fiasco. All of this on the back of the Jio Platforms narrative or the \"look, I'm a tech company, not a telecom company\" narrative. Why are so many PE funds like General Atlantic, Vista Equity, Silver Lake etc cutting such big checks for Jio? These PE firms are filled with some of the most academically sound men and women who seem to be making a disastrous investment in my opinion.\n\nI will be the first to admit that Jio probably has been the single most dynamic, David taking on the Goliath type of story. I can't remember of a company entering an industry from scratch and going on to dominate the industry in a span of four years like Jio has dominated the telecom industry in India. But if you come to think of it, a lot of Jio's domination of conventional telecom in India is down to the basic core competencies of RIL. \n\nThe first is enormous capital investment. RIL has been the only company that I feel has had the stomach to time and again undertake massive capital investments. From Jamnagar refinery to Reliance Retail and Jio. RIL has taken up enormous debts to undertake capital projects which few companies can undertake thanks to the sheer amount of money required to undertake these projects. And capital was something that was sourly missing in the Indian telecom scene. Airtel, Vodafone and Idea had created a cartel which was so indebted with the 3G auctions that they used to charge an insane 249\/GB of 3G data. They were in no mood of investing in 4G and their plans were stupid. What would be the utility of using 33MB of 3G data per day for 249Rs per month? Airtel, Vodafone and Idea were just milking the users without any tangible benefit. \n\nIn comes RIL with its dollars and a kick-ass 4G network which covered all of India and Jio was willing to give out free data for like half a year. If I were to tell you that there was a bullet train that was offering free rides and your conventional Rajdhani was charging you 600 for one stop to the next, which one would you choose? I think the answer is simple here.\n\nThen comes RIL's next core competency, lobbying. Now things get murkier here as there are a lot of allegations without substantial proof but we all know that RIL has over the years managed to get a lot of laws auto-magically in its favor. Telecom was no different. From the conversion of its ISP license to UASL to using Infotel as a front in the 4G spectrum auctions, RIL played all its cards right to ensure that the laws in general were favorable to Jio. The ISP to UASL conversion at a mere 1k-2k crores saved RIL probably tens of thousands of crores during spectrum auctions.\n\nThe third is operational excellence. RIL made a great decision by going 4G only as the market for 4G devices was super mature by the time they launched. This helped them save money on running 2G and 3G networks. Next, tying up Samsung as their sole equipment provider probably provided some discounts and uniformity across the network. True to its roots, RIL is planning go down stream in telecom as well and plans to become a telecom equipment manufacturer as per media reports. All the more savings.\n\nCombine these three and its not tough to see why Jio pulled off what it pulled off in telecom. The sector was in some way the perfect playground for a company like RIL and with no external adversaries and a favorable political climate, the fact that Jio came to dominate telecom in such a short span should be no surprise.\n\nNow come to Jio Platforms, RIL is now selling itself as tech and services company. But no matter how hard I think, I cannot wrap my mind as to how RIL's core competencies will in any way help Jio Platforms.\n\nLets start with Jio Mart. Jio Mart is most probably why Facebook cut the biggest check of everyone investing in Jio Platform. Yes, I agree that both Jio and WhatsApp have around 300-400 million people as a potential audience but this is where all there benefits end. There is nothing else. Zilch. Now Jio Mart claims that it will connect the local seller or retailer with customers online. However, e-commerce is not as simple as having a potential captive audience waiting to be untapped. E-Commerce is India is a mess. There are a lot of fake sellers online. Like a LOT. Amazon India claims to be an e-commerce marketplace just like what Jio Mart is proposing but if you look closely, a lot of products on Amazon are sold by Cloudtail, Appario Retail, Amazon Retail and some combination of these 4-5 mega sellers.\n\nEvery time you buy from these 4-5 mega sellers, you are in effect buying from Amazon. Over the years, Amazon has realized that decentralized e-commerce in India will never be effective. A lot of seller fraud happens in India. So much so that Amazon eventually had to tie up with a bunch of blue chip Indian companies and become a seller themselves. Amazon owns like 49% in most of these 4-5 mega sellers just to comply with Indian laws. Operationally everything is handled by Amazon. This was the case with Flipkart as well where a seller named WS Retail used to handle everything. Flipkart decided to go down the decentralized path and now regrets its decision. Ever since WS Retail lost its dominance in Flipkart, product quality fell rapidly. So the grand theme is this - Acting as a platform for a gazillion sellers is something both Flipkart and Amazon have spent tons of time and resources at and failed. I fail to see how Jio would fix that.\n\nTwo of RIL's core competencies are of no use in Jio Mart. If you're talking about capital then good luck competing with Amazon. Jeff Bezos will invest every single penny of his free cash flow and his shareholders are also OK with it and trust me, AWS is a much bigger money maker than RIL's Jamnagar will ever be. Second, as far as operational efficiency is considered, Amazon and Flipkart have spent years bringing down unit costs and most of their riders deliver a heck ton of parcels. Again, not sure how RIL can compete here. There is one place where RIL wins, lobbying. RIL could get the government to make life tough for Amazon and Flipkart. But as Cloudtail etc all are proof, every law of government will be met with a creative work around. Also in case of commerce, RIL will be up against tons of small retailers whose collective political capital would trump RIL any day.\n\nAmazon and Flipkart have already become the default e-commerce destination for the creamy top 200 million Indians. In India, the 80-20 rule becomes more evident than anywhere else. Once you leave the top 200 million people, the remaining 800 million simply do not have enough purchasing power. Asking someone to leave their trusted Amazon or Flipkart for Jio Mart is an uphill task. People sub consciously these days first open Amazon or Flipkart and then search elsewhere for anything else.\n\nNow lets come to software and services. As far as I know none of Jio's apps make much money despite being downloaded so many times. Getting people to pay for content in India where YouTube series are often better than cable TV is an uphill task. You could literally find anything you want on YouTube from music to TV shows and watch them without paying a single penny. Even YouTube wouldn't be able to up sell people to YouTube premium in India let alone Jio.\n\nLastly, creating software and services that people use is a different ball game altogether. You cannot just buy this. Apple sits on a mountain of cash but its cash position is not why iPhones sell like hot cakes but its because of the kind of culture most of these tech companies have. Creating that perfect UI\/UX requires a culture more than anything else. Tech companies spend decades perfecting this culture and it shows. PhonePe launched earlier than Google Pay yet Google Pay is the leader today because its minimalist UI\/UX was an instant hit with Indian masses. You can't just throw money and get this UI\/UX. You need to have a culture where everyone right from the coder to the product manager thinks along these lines. And this culture doesn't come by having open offices or free food. It comes when like minded people come together and spend insane amounts of time studying UI\/UX flows and how people respond to them. This is definitely not the culture at RIL. This is also something you can't lobby around. You can't ask the government to make minimalist UI illegal so that Google is at a disadvantage or ask them to make double tap to like illegal so Instagram is in trouble. \n\nI maybe wrong here. There maybe something I am missing here. After all the Whartons and Harvards of PE firms have invested for far longer than me and with far more internal data. But whatever happens, I have developed an admiration for Mukesh Ambani. Regardless of whether Jio Platforms proves to be whatever its lofty claims are, Mr. Ambani has managed to par down a significant amount of debt for very little equity dilution, that too during the worst health crisis of modern times.","answer":"Brilliant post dude. The few opportunity buckets you are missing are -\n1) Reliance has acquired multiple other startups as well, and is aiming for bigger pie in the digital India\n2) it won't be directly competing on b2c front but on b2b front...which is highly fragmented and runs manually\n3) India is a brilliant market and there is no easy way for outside firms to get a foothold here on themselves. So, PE\/tech firms are betting on the best suited player for the task."}
{"question":"RANT: In Praise of MFUtility Not sure how many people are aware of [MFUtility](https:\/\/www.mfuindia.com\/InvestorFAQ) and what the advantages are, so thought I'd write a mini-article about it.\n\nDisclaimer: _no affiliation with anybody in the ecosystem, just a private investor._\n\n# What's the big deal, anyway?\n\nMFUtility is a direct subsidiary of AMFI (Association for MF in India). It thus holds a unique place in the MF ecosystem -- it can\n\n* act like a RTA, able to pull from\/push to the other RTAs (CAMS, KFinTech, FTAMIL)\n* act as an execution platform\n* act as a client-facing platform\n\nNone of any other competitors have all of the privileges, so can only do one or more parts of the puzzle. Let's discuss what the advantages provided. If you're not sure about the above points, see the key concepts section below.\n\n# Advantages\n\n## Almost all AMCs are supported\n\nAlthough this isn't a major selling point nowadays as most execution platforms have caught up, MFUtility supports most of the AMCs you might want to invest in. A few years ago when Franklin didn't work with most platforms, MFUtility had it on-board for everything (_nowadays Franklin may not be so attractive for investors, though_).\n\n## Unmatched visibility and processing\n\nDue to it supporting everything, you have unmatched transaction visibility and options for processing. You must be aware that you only get the NAV when the money reaches the AMC for investments above 2 lakh; SEBI has recently [released a circular that this will be applicable for all investments](https:\/\/www.sebi.gov.in\/legal\/circulars\/sep-2020\/circular-on-mutual-funds_47574.html) from Jan 1, 2021. A sample log available from MFU is shown below.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/7e6IB4W\n\nYou can pay MFU in various ways; the easiest way to ensure that it reaches MFU on time is using NEFT\/RTGS. If you know the timings on which your bank processes NEFT (generally every 30 minutes), you can make sure it reaches them before the 12\/1pm cut-off. They have a tie up with banks which allows you to transfer money to a \"virtual\" account number which contains your CAN -- and it shows up in the trace shown above within a few minutes. They also support mandate registration and netbanking, if you want.\n\n## Automatic sync of transactions\n\nDue to its nature, the current portfolio gets updated automatically based on the PAN. **No one else** can offer that, all they can do is trigger a CAS and upload it. RTA applications (myCAMS \/ KFinKart) have similiar privileges, but only for investments with the given RTA. All other clients platforms are only pushed updates if their ARN\/RIA number is associated with the folio at the time of creation; further transactions do not affect this status. They have to talk to the execution platform and compute the net units, which requires reconciliation and hence can be error-prone when the platform is young.\n\n## Single window updation of details\n\nOther than address details (which have to be updated at the KRA level), everything about your investments just needs to be updated in MFUtility and it will sync to every AMC\/folio. Changing the email and phone number is an online process, while changing the bank details requires you to submit a form physically but it gets updated everywhere.\n\n## Redemptions, Redemptions, Redemptions\n\nDue to the RTA-like nature, at the time of redemption you can override the bank account in which you want the proceeds to be credited. This is huge, and **I recommend everyone to create an account just for this reason**. Over a period of time, everything may change and this proves invaluable. A relative of mine had investments in Franklin which were\n\n* having an email address associated with a company they were no longer employed with;\n* phone number was that of the distributor, not their mobile;\n* address was the same office mentioned above;\n* bank account was with salary account above, which was defunct.\n\nThey had forgotten about this investment -- after I asked them to sign up to MFUtility, they discovered it. Franklin couldn't help, as none of the details matched -- would've required multiple physical visits. As the latest bank account details were updated in MFU, they redeemed the amount to that account. As the folio was not coming up in the CAS, a ticket in MFU ensured that they did pushed it manually and everything was synced &amp; the CAS reflected these details (required for Capital Gains for CA).\n\n## Granular control of Folios\n\nYou can have as many folios as you want, and can even choose to create new folios at the time of investment. This is useful when you follow a folio-per-financial-year strategy, as you can choose to do tax-loss\/tax-gain harvesting as per your convenience. As the FIFO principle is followed when redeeming and India doesn't have any wash sale rules, this allows you to do fine-grained optimisation which may not be as easy to implement with other platforms.\n\n## Multiple holding patterns\n\nA single login in MFU can have access to multiple CANs (e.g. I have me, me + spouse, me as guardian of child) and all of them work the same way. My spouse has a separate CAN and can see their as well as joint folios. While this is not as convenient as the features offered by other portals (which allow managing extended family portfolios), it's good enough for my requirements.\n\n## Loads of features\n\nRead up about CaST, CaRT and CaST Triggers -- they offer a lot of flexibility. As an example, I never have any SIPs set up -- depending on the amount of money available after paying off credit cards, I decide to invest an X amount and do a weekly CaST for X\/4 or X\/5 (depending on the weeks in month), which gives slightly better averaging than a single monthly SIP. I can also tweak the proportion of investments, and it just requires setting up a transaction once per month (I have PayEzzz mandate setup; if not they will email you a reminder\/payment link for netbanking).\n\n## Will probably survive\n\nMFUtility has been in operation for 5 years and is likely to be around for the future, which is not something you can say for the other client-facing platforms. They also have a revenue model which makes sense: the AMCs pay them for providing the services (_they started out as a backend for distributors_), so unless there's a huge shakeup it's likely to continue. That's not the case for the competitors who don't charge any fees, where is revenue going to come from? They will pivot and try other avenues to raise revenues, reducing focus on their core MF product (witness the threads complaining about a few promiment competitors in the last few days).\n\n# What's the catch?\n\n## Extremely old-fashioned UI\n\nThe UI is very old-fashioned and has a lot of options -- if you want a smooth flow and very good UI\/UX, you won't get it. While some people on this sub absolutely hate it, I consider the advantages and accept it as a cost of using it. You may feel different, but for god's sake at least open an account for the redemption and single window details updation!\n\n## Transactions-only, no reporting\n\nThere is absolutely no reporting available. It doesn't show you returns\/details on any fund; you are expected to do your research and choose the exact fund you want to invest in. Neither does it show you the cost basis and your P&amp;L or invested XIRR -- you're supposed to do that on your own.\n\nWhile this may be another major negative for people, I personally find it an advantage. It is common wisdom that you shouldn't look at returns daily but invest and forget -- but most other client platforms exclusively show that every time you login. The temptation to check out some other recommended fund is just too much. I specifically [choose to increase the friction](https:\/\/behaviouralinvestment.com\/2020\/09\/03\/a-little-bit-of-friction-can-make-us-better-long-term-investors\/) in computing my returns -- it's a quarterly\/half-yearly activity where I choose to review and decide to rebalance my asset allocation\/choice of funds. That said, not everybody may _want_ this friction and if so, MFUtility is not for you.\n\n## PSU-like service\n\nWhile glitches are infrequent, they can happen. Their service won't be up-to-the-mark like you can expect from the client-facing portals, but is mitigated by a few factors:\n\n* you have unmatched visibility, so you don't need to reach out as often\n* any interaction with the AMC (which they forward to) happens at L2 or L3 level, instead of L1 you would get via normal channels. So it may take a bit longer, but in case of complex cases it won't take as long as it would via normal channels.\n\n## Default distributor orientation\n\nMFUtility was originally built for distributors\/RIAs, and that orientation shows up in various ways. If you have ever invested via a distributor\/RIA, it may include those values \"to help you\" when creating new orders. This may lead to only regular plans being shown on the next screen for scheme selection. Always make sure to change the default preferences -- you can access them by clicking the gear icon on the top.\n\n# Key Concepts\n\n* AMC (Asset Management Company): Fund House you're investing with\n* RTA (Registrar &amp; Transfer Agent): Handles all bookkeeping for an AMC\n* KRA (KYC Registration Agency): Stores KYC information; shared with AMC on first investment\n* ARN (Application Ref Number): Unique code identifying a distributor\/advisor (_mostly for regular funds_)\n* RIA (Registered Inv Advisor): Code for RIAs\/direct-only platforms\n* Execution Platform: takes orders\/payments on behalf of investors\/distributors and forwards to RTA\/AMC\n* Client Platform: takes orders\/shows folio from actual investors.","answer":"This post is absolutely well-written and was badly needed too. I mean, here is a wonderful platform that provides almost everything that any DIY MF investor needs + wants, and yet it's not getting adequate coverage just because it doesn't have a cool UI or dollars to spend on youtube ads? At least on this forum, I expected more mentions of this platform but I only see people speaking here about absolutely pale apps and brokerages and wallets as MF transaction portals in spite of their pathetic customer service! \n\nNot to forget, MFU has come a long way over these five years and still keeps improving and innovating... You can now have a totally online application process, right with eCAN and engage with any AMc or RTA through a single grievance portal. They even had introduced ePayEezz (suspended now due to the Aadhaar authentication ruling, but I hope they come with a workaround.) \n\nSometimes there are still some gaps. (E.g. SIP \/ STP transaction history is not regularly updated - usually due to RTA fault. Or some special STPs - e.g. flex STP or value STP - are not available, only variable STP is.)  But those are minor inconveniences.\n\n**I wish MFU adds reporting &amp; portfolio features and then it will be a killer services!**"}

{"question":"Why would someone sell an apartment complex if their monthly revenue from rent is greater then the mortgage? My brother and I were recently looking into real estate but it all seems too good to be true. Housing has become a major problem in our area and the influx of college students is exponentially increasing. We want to capitalize on this. \n\nOne of the apartment complexes we were looking at generated $1000 monthly revenue from rent, but the mortgage was only $700 a month? Why would anyone be willing to sell this apartment complex if they are already making more money then they are shelling out?\n\nShit just doesn\u2019t add up, any explanation would be helpful!","answer":"Lots of reasons. The exact situation that led to a recent sale for me:\n\nI bought a distressed complex in fall of 2018 for $1M. It was part of a legal dispute between owners who were suing each other, so it had fallen into disrepair as the lawsuit drug out. The court appointed someone to manage it, but they weren\u2019t allowed to spend any money on it beyond absolutely necessary maintenance to make it habitable. But it was in a quickly improving area.\n\nI spent $400k renovating the complex. Upgraded dated interiors, rebranded the whole place, got rid of the drug units and non-paying tenants, etc. So I\u2019m in for $1.4M, and I would have been happy owning for 20 years. It was a great property, and it cash flowed nicely once we got the new tenants at a much higher rate than the previous shitshow was getting.\n\nThen about a year ago, I was approached by several buyers offering around $3M for the place. While the cash flow is nice, it would have taken like 15 years for me to make the money from selling. But the real kicker is that I could do a 1031 exchange with the profit and buy a $5M property. I\u2019ve added nothing to my initial 2018 investment (which was only like $350k total), but now I was able to lever up to a much larger asset that is going to cash flow even more, pay down even more debt, etc."}

I think he acquitted himself well, and seems like the kind of guy you want running a mine, which is an area of expertise many hopefuls lack. His interview felt very general in nature, like RIO's: you could've replaced 'lithium' with any commodity during the course of the discussion, and it would've fit. In that sense, he's still a newcomer finding his feet in the industry, which is probably why he slightly fumbled the 'long term vision' question (38:00). I've mentioned my criticism before of locking themselves into the bottom of the supply chain, but I don't see it influencing the SP for the next 18mths.  \nOne thing I want to counter is Ottaviano's comment on spodumene processing, which he described as a \"simple process\" (21:50).  \nIt's definitely not a simple process:\n\n||\\*\\*ore grade\\*\\*|\\*\\*spodumene grade\\*\\*|\\*\\*DFS recovery\\*\\*|\\*\\*real recovery\\*\\*|beneficiation|  \n:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|  \n|IGO|2%|6%|-|65-75%|DMS &amp; flotation|  \n|PLS|1.14%|5.5-6%|77%|61-72%|DMS &amp; flotation|  \n|MIN (Mt Marion)|1.37%|4-6%|-|90%^(1)|DMS &amp; flotation|  \n|MIN (Wodgina)|1.17%|6%|65%|-|DMS &amp; flotation|  \n|AKE (Mt Cattlin)|1.2%|5.7%^(2)|-|55%^(2)|DMS|  \n|AJM|1.06%|6%|80%|55%|DMS &amp; flotation|  \n|A40 (Bald Hill)|1.0%|6%|66%|67%|DMS|  \n|LTR|1.4%|6%|78%|-|DMS &amp; flotation|  \n|CXO|1.3%|5.8%|72%|-|DMS|  \n|SYA\/PLL|1.06%|6%|68%|-|DMS &amp; flotation|  \n|LLL|1.45%|6%|80%|-|DMS &amp; flotation|  \n|AVZ|1.63%|6%|60%|-|DMS|\n\n^(1) recovery unusually high due to SC4%  \n^(2) based on average over a few years\n\nI guess the expectation that CXO will fail to achieve their DFS numbers is one of the reasons that [short interest is looking rusted on](https:\/\/www.shortman.com.au\/stock?q=CXO). Though there does appear to be some great swing trade opportunities if some of those shorts get temporarily unwound, which happened on the 20th &amp; 21st.  \nIf lithium prices remain strong over the next 18 weeks, I wonder if it'll rattle the short thesis at all. Interestingly, [SYA is the only pre-producer that isn't prone to such pressure](https:\/\/www.shortman.com.au\/stock?q=SYA) (except AGY, due to lack of available shares). Is it because PLL hold 17% of the float, and don't loan those shares out? Otherwise, I've no explanation.\n\nGoing back to the LTR interview, Ottaviano identified timelines as a key challenge, saying they were \"up against it\" (32:32) for a Q2 2024 start. Further confirmation that WA, the world's only serious source of lithium supply relief, is looking in terrible shape for the next 18 months.\n\nThe other day, [I disagreed with Rodney Hooper about LFP v ternary costs](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ASX_Bets\/comments\/w6qea5\/comment\/ihfbbyk\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

{"question":"Do rent controls 'work'? Hi guys,\n\nVery contentious question here, do rent controls make renters better off?\n\nI've heard two sides, one side is that yes it does it prevents renters from price gouging; especially in areas with a 'monopolized' housing market i.e. where there are only a handful of different landlords who actually own the housing in said area thereby having more power to set rents at the price that they see fit.\n\nThe other is that it leads to less new houses being built, restricting supply, and raising rent as a result.\n\nWhich one is it?\n\nDoes the fact that housing is an inherently scarce asset given that land is finite especially in urban areas play a part in answering this question?\n\nAll the best","answer":"No, rent controls do not work in the long run. This is because they reduce the incentives to supply more housing in the future, leading to higher prices for the unlucky people who aren't living in rent-controlled homes. \n\n[This  shows it better than I can explain.](https:\/\/pressbooks.bccampus.ca\/uvicecon103\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/58\/2016\/11\/Figure-4.6a.jpg) The gap between the amount demanded and amount supplied shows a shortage of housing as a result of a price cap being implemented.\n\nThere is also empirical evidence against the implementation of rent controls. [This paper proved that rent controls lead to an \"overconsumption\" of housing,](https:\/\/www.journals.uchicago.edu\/doi\/abs\/10.1086\/259959?journalCode=jpe&amp;) which is exactly what the model above predicted would happen.\n\nThey also lead to losses in welfare. [This analysis of rent controls in NYC estimated  that it lead to a loss of about 500 million dollars,](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/000282803769206188) without even attempting to estimate the social losses as a result of the undersupply of housing\n\nRent controls are also extremely hard to undo once implemented. People in rent-controlled apartments will vote against any changes to the rent-control laws while the people who aren't able to live in the area as a result of it being too expensive aren't able to. \nHowever, there are alternative policies to make housing much more affordable which actually works in the long-run. Building more housing by undoing the constraints of supply on housing like zoning laws.\n\n[Housing supply has been made inelastic](https:\/\/voxeu.org\/article\/declining-elasticity-us-housing-supply) by decades of stringent and absurd requirements imposed on developers by NIMBY homeowners, [leading to an undersupply of housing in places like SF](https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2021\/03\/18\/how-can-we-solve-the-bay-area-housing-crisis-build-160000-affordable-homes\/) and [NYC](https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/housing\/problem\/problem.page). If housing supply was allowed to respond to increases in supply, there wouldn't be a housing affordability crisis at all.\n\nRent control looks like a simple solution for housing unaffordability but in reality it makes the problem much worse."}
{"question":"Rant: I just keep feeling poor forever Just a rant. \n\nHave you ever read John Scalzi\u2019s internet essay \u201cBeing Poor\u201d?

But, I also think that anyone who has gone to community college part time can understand what a burn that is. Because it\u2019s basically a worthless paper you pay for, after busting your ass for years, balancing work, family and school.\n\nAnyways, that is a preface to what I want to say today. Oh one, more point that Scalzi makes, \u201cBeing poor is having to live with choices you didn\u2019t know you made when you were 14 years old.\u201d\n\nShit, I\u2019ve been making bad \u201cchoices\u201d since the day I was conceived. I grew up with white, high-school educated, working class parents. My dad had six kids by the time he was 30. Bad decision I made being born. We moved four times (that I remember) before I started kindergarten. I was homeless for a month following the death of my infant brother during first grade (SIDS is correlated with poverty btw). In some ways I had privilege, like my race, and extended family that we could stay with when we were in between apartments, etc. And in other ways I got the shit end of the stick, no money for healthcare, ill-fitting hand-me-down clothes, depressed parents who often weren\u2019t around due to work and their own mental illness and addictions, no enriching activities (besides camping), and just a general lack of opportunity that middle class kids are offered. I wasn\u2019t physically abused, so I am grateful for that.\n\nThis all developed into me not being a model student as you can imagine. I got good grades, (maybe because I had a mother who read to me) but my parents couldn\u2019t have told you the difference between AP and remedial classes, they couldn\u2019t tell you the difference between community college and university, they couldn\u2019t tell you want graduate school was, they didn\u2019t have money for dance lessons, tutors, or travel. They subtly encouraged me and my siblings to follow them into their lines of work, restaurant and auto body work. My father\u2019s spelling is adorable and frighteningly awful. My mom used to ask me to call people for her because I \u201csound professional\u201d as she put it. She knew her class came across in her accent, mispronounced words and inability to form a logical argument.\n\nI took the inevitable (?) \u201cpoor girl route\u201d and got pregnant while I was both young and unmarried. I wasn\u2019t a \u201cslut.\u201d He was my second boyfriend I ever had in my life; there was a very short time between me being able to describe myself as a virgin and as pregnant. I didn\u2019t try to \u201ctrap him\u201d, I legit didn\u2019t know how easy it was to get pregnant. I had never gone to the gynecologist before that point (why don\u2019t high schools offer free gynecological services?!) and I was not on birth control. I was 19. I was just scraping by living in an apartment with a friend. My boyfriend said he\u2019d support me in whatever choice I made. I wanted to give this child a chance at life. After all, I had felt that my youngest brother was cheated out of his life. I had the baby. She changed my life, and she is my life. \n\nNow, she is the age I was when I was pregnant with her. She is on birth control, she is in college, she is on a good path in life. She has had a life of doctors\u2019 visits, enriching summer classes, trips out of town. She had teachers who told her she was smart and that she had a future. She is awesome. We once were on medical assistance and food stamps and free lunch. Now, we are not. \n\nI pulled myself out of poverty. I do not qualify for assistance anymore. I pay real rent, and I can pay all my bills and even save money sometimes. Two years ago I went on a two-week vacation to Europe. I was miles away from being the little girl in dirty clothes with bad teeth and teachers who told her that she smelled. I was miles away from being the single mom having her hours cut because her daughter was sick and she couldn\u2019t find back up child care when day care wouldn\u2019t allow her in. I should be happy, right? \n\nNow, I have a job that ways almost 42,000 a year. Why the fuck am I posting to \u201cpovertyfinance?\u201d \n\nBecause I am tired. I\u2019m so fucking tired. I work with people ten years younger than me, who make the same or better pay. They are buying houses with gifts from their in-laws. My parents cannot afford to give me a down payment and I know I\u2019ll never be able to save up enough to afford one. My car is literally falling apart, and the idea that I\u2019ll need to add a car payment on top of my other costs is killing me. I am trying to help my daughter as much as I can, so that she doesn\u2019t need to take out loans. I sometimes long for the days of Sect 8 housing and food stamps. Maybe I am just kidding myself. I\u2019m NOT POOR ANYMORE. I know that. Why do I still feel that way?  \n\n\nI\u2019ll never get married again (I had one brief and unhappy marriage) Men want to date 25 year olds, not 40 year olds. When I meet men on dating sites, they ask me what my hobbies are. \u201cDo I ski? Do I go salsa dancing? Why don\u2019t I purse a Master\u2019s degree?\u201d\n\nWhat I want to say to those men\u2026When did you learn to ski? Who taught you and provided the equipment? Who watched your kid and paid for the babysitter and the dance lessons? WHY the FUCK would I go back to college? Who\u2019s doing to pay for that? Should get more student loans so I can come out making $47,000? I\u2019m making \u201centry level\u201d wages for a Bachelor\u2019s degree, and yes, of course I earned a terrible, unprofitable bachelor\u2019s degree. Nothing practical or in-demand. That\u2019s something else my parents and I didn\u2019t know as uneducated working class people: the difference between a history degree and an accounting degree. Successful men don\u2019t want to date someone like me. I\u2019ve been treading water for 40 years.\n\nMy parents are at the age where they are retiring with no savings and ill health. FML\n\nMy kid is getting out of this, and I guess that I how I can die knowing my life wasn\u2019t a complete waste. \n\nUntil then, I am living paycheck to paycheck, wondering how the fuck I can\u2019t thrive on the pay I receive right now. I am anti-consumption, I have very few wants, but I just can\u2019t seem to find peace of mind. I\u2019m meditating but I haven\u2019t found peace yet. All I want to do is escape. \n\nI am so sick of car insurance, car repairs, buying work clothes, paying for medical costs, god damn broken iphone5 screens, the price of everything going up, society\u2019s expectations. Needing \u201cpayments\u201d just to live. I just want to live without having to get loans. I want to live without having to get a Master\u2019s Degree. I want to love without throwing myself at successful men, hoping one will share his bounty of resources. I\u2019ve long given up to the \u201cprince charming knight in shining armor\u201d bill of goods sold to little girls looking for escape. I used to pray to be saved, and I worked so hard to save myself. I don\u2019t pray anymore. But I search for peace. I just want a break from these fucking choices I made before I realized they were choices. I want a break from 4 years of night school. I want a break from looking like a desperate whore. I want a break from applying for credit. \n\nI know that life is suffering and I should make peace with that, and I realize that I am not even suffering. These are first world problems etc. I\u2019m not poor anymore. I just wish I could shake this poor feeling. Does it ever go away?\n\n\nThank you for listeing to me. \n\nTfLDR rant about how I grew up poor, had a baby, started to work my way out of poverty,\u201dmade it\u201d out if official poverty, but still feel poor\/like crap sometimes.\n\nUPDATE\/EDIT Reddit, you all are making me cry, laugh, feel validated.

{"question":"Rate my portfolio Hello,\n\nI want to start investing 500 Euro\/month for a long time (20y). I'll also wait for corrections and invest a lump-sum (&gt;10,000k EUR).

{"question":"Kicked out of Penn State because my parents did not have the credit to co-sign loans. I owe $8,000~ directly to my campus, with a 24 month no interest payment plan. Now living with my GF's parents, working 2 jobs, while my GF gets COVID unemployment. Could I get some tips on figuring everything out? Long story short, I got into Penn State via the PASSS program, a program that let me trial-run a few classes in the summer via Zoom, because my grades were so bad in HS - I only qualified cus I got a 1260 on my SATs, and I was the first person in my family to go to college. I moved out of my parents' house got a 3.65 GPA in those PASSS classes, while supporting myself at the same time. I got to move into the dorms and stop working\/doing school 60+ hours a week, and got a 3.93 GPA, ending up with a cumulative 3.85 GPA.\n\nI got kicked out due to financial issues when my parents tried to cosign for a variety of private loans, only to be denied on all of them. I'm now working 2 jobs and living with my girlfriend's parents, who have welcomed me in. I owe just under $8,000 to PSU, and have made a payment plan with them - 24 months, no interest or late fees, nothing is reported to my credit until it's all paid off. I work just over 70 hours a week most weeks, and usually can be expected to bring in around 1700~ a month - this is very conservative. My girlfriend makes almost exactly $2,000 on COVID UI.\n\nWe have budgeted everything out with conservative income estimates. Long story short again, we both have a number of bills. She has a small amount of credit card debt remaining, student loans, and a car payment, while I have PSU payments. We also have medication payments, insurance, all of our expenses totaled. We end up with around $1,200 at the end of the month between both of us. With this $1,200, we are putting money away into a few things.\n\n- $500\/month into our emergency expenses fund. We want 3 months of emergency expenses, as is often given as good advice. Our current expenses are around $1,700, but we expect that to reduce with my gf's bills being paid off soon, so we want our 3 months expenses total to be around $5,000. \n\n- $350\/month into advance PSU payments. I'm putting this into its own separate fund, so that when next year's late applications arrive (I've been told by the colleges I want to attend that it's in May) I can just dump all of his money into my PSU debt and have it wiped out so I can attend. It's being kept until then in case I have a change of plans on college, or if there's an emergency.\n\n- $200\/month for groceries. This is what we've set our goal at.\n\n- $150\/month for emergency medical or clothing. We're setting this money aside into another separate account in case we need emergency tooth treatment, shoes fall apart, etc. this expense is only temporary, we're hoping to save $600\/750 total before we stop.\n\nWe are currently aggressively hitting my girlfriend's credit cards based on interest rates. We have set a list of priorities of what needs payment, with her credit cards being in 1st and 2nd, her car payment being in third, with my PSU savings being at the bottom. \n\nMy main concerns are how best we can save money, what public assistance programs we can get, rent assistance, phone, internet, etc. Not only this, but how I will be able to personally secure a private student loan even if I have bad credit. My parents wrecked my credit, but I have managed to bring it up to the low 650's. Do you all think I can get good enough credit by next year to apply for one? I have currently gotten the Capitol One Platinum Card and will be using it and making payments to bring up my credit. Also, is there a way to make my PSU monthly payments affect my credit? \n\nEverything's just kind of a mess and I'm being thrown head first into this world. I work over 70 hours a week and barely get time to even do research on these things. I have no idea what to do, and any assistance is greatly appreciated.","answer":"You should be very careful in paying off your girlfriends credit.

It was possible to trade HFT strategies from Excel sheets during that time, but even basic entry-level technology these days would require colo and microwave connections.  Except the last few months, volatility has been down massively during the long bull market (and correspondingly, alpha opportunities are far fewer), volumes are down, and the large shops have gained much more market share and AUM.  Way more sharks fighting over a smaller pool of fish.\n\nIf you are set on trading HFT on your own money, I would recommend entering less competitive markets like emerging stock markets or crypto.  But even those are becoming a lot more saturated over the past 2-3 years.\n\nOther than HFT, you could still explore longer time frame algo strategies which would have alphas with longer half lives.

{"question":"Delta vs Probability ITM Can anyone provide some context on the differences between these and which you use personally when looking at opening spreads?

Where N is the CDF of the normal distribution function.\n\nSo delta will be a good approximation of PITM if and only if d1 \\~ d2.\n\nThe difference between d1 and d2 is IV\\*sqrt(DTE).\n\nSo if IV is very high, or the option has a long DTE, delta and PITM will diverge by much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, ignoring dividends, and interest rates, an ATM call option has a 50% chance of expiring ITM.

{"question":"Are Indian equity markets overvalued? I started my investing journey from mid last year and it seems that Indian equity markets have been continuously overvalued since then? The PE ratio of Nifty 50 has varied from 27-29 during this period. Due to this reason, I've only been investing in debt mutual funds since the past year.\n\nHow do you handle such periods? Do you wait for the PE to come down to 23-24 and invest in debt in the meanwhile? Or do you still continue to invest through SIPs into equity mutual funds?","answer":"I was this guy not too long ago - waiting for a good time to enter the markets. But a year has passed since the point where I was worried about the stocks being expensive - the nifty 50 PE was over 2 standard deviations above normal and that is event that has a probability of just little over 2% in a gaussian distribution. And guess what? today the stock market is even higher, even more expensive. It's either going to go up or down or sideways for the next year, and I don't know which it's going to pick. I doubt you do either. \n\nLucky for me, I believed what I read and the past history and so I kept investing regularly and right now the xirr is about 10%. If I had waited for cheaper stocks, I'd still be waiting, probably.\n\nThe thing that most people miss is this - If the stock market is expensive, and then in the next year it goes up by 30% and falls by say 20% it's still more expensive than before - and you are a year late. And there is no way you'd know what the bottom is anyway - so you might miss it too. The slow and steady Sip guy would not miss the bottom. \n\nI don't mean to say buy 100% stocks - instead stick to your asset allocation and ride it out. If there is a 30% crash, then maybe sell some debt fund and put it back into equity gradually, if you really wish to. That's perhaps the only way to time the market.\n\nOther than that, stop worrying. None of us know what the market is gonna do next."}

{"question":"You have 32 ETH. Would you stake? As we're gearing up for PoS, I'm curious how many people would jump right in as soon as they can, wait, or something else? If you had 32 ETH, what would you do?","answer":"Right now, yes probably. I would want to maintain my right to my ETH and, as the other alternatives are all based on Dai, the MKR stability fee is currently outrageous. Staking 32 ETH is at least a valid way to earn a return.\n\n\nBy the time staking truly rolls around though, my guess is probably not. The MKR stability fee will probably be reasonable which will open up the ability to use all sorts of DeFi platforms while retaining ownership of your ETH. Compound, dydx, Dharma, Uniswap, and the like will probably offer better returns.  This may normalize somewhat (the fewer stakers, the higher share of the staking pool...), but there will always be a certain percentage of people who stake for irrational reason (such as feeling it a duty or obligation).  Watching the genesis of the DeFi movement makes me believe there is real promise in the space. Decentralized finance may be Ethereum\u2019s killer app."}
{"question":"Retirement In Place (RIP). What are your experiences? Let's say that you can't retire early, but you've completely stopped caring about meetings and management politics, and your goal is to sacrifice as little time and emotional energy as possible. \n\nI've learned the hard way that working too hard leads to conflict as gets you just as fired as you'd be if you had done nothing. So what about joining the useless 50-90 percent who do next to nothing and manage to stay employed for as long as they'd like? Spending that time building passive income streams seems like a better use of time than playing games on Facebook, no?\n\nThis seems harder than it should be to make work. It's not as hard for most people, who just don't care. Most people are really good at the slacking game. I think that's because everyone knows they're mediocre, not much is expected of them but to show up for a couple meetings. But if you show promise in the first few months when you actually give a shit... before it becomes clear that the bosses see you as just a regular worker, not a protege, and that there's therefore no reason to actually work... and then become a zombie like everyone else (or, worse from the boss's perspective, start throwing your time behind your own projects)... it doesn't seem to end well.\n\nHas anyone here made the Retirement-In-Place strategy work, while building savings and using as much time as possible to work on one's own projects?

{"question":"Warning for anyone looking to open a Charles Schwab checking account... I recently opened a Charles Schwab checking account after reading great reviews from Reddit. I have absolutely loved it.\n\nHowever, I ran into a problem today.\n\nThe online Schwab portal stopped updating my transactions past the middle of the month. I had a credit card payment, rent payment, and a paycheck that all should have shown up under my transactions but didn't.\n\nI contacted Schwab customer service and they informed me there was a restriction on my account due to a pending address verification. So I contacted the relevant department and verified my address. They told me my transactions should be updated shortly. All good right? Nope!\n\nAfter waiting half an hour, I contacted them again. Turns out, NONE of my transactions had actually gone through. All of them were either returned\/cancelled because of this restriction. They then informed me that I would need to contact each vendor to have the payment submitted again.\n\nNow here's the worst part: I was never once notified of any restriction on my account. They stated I was sent a letter, but I have opened every piece of mail from Schwab and nothing mentions address verification. On top of that, the account was working perfectly up until the middle of this month.\n\nI wanted to make this post for anyone that is either considering opening a Schwab account or might have this issue in the future.\n\nFOR THE RECORD: Schwab customer service was excellent all three times I spoke to them. I also expressed my frustration about the situation, but never once directed it at the agents. I assured them it was not their fault. I still think the Schwab checking account is a great option for a High Yield Checking Account. I would recommend it to anyone. But I wanted to get this out there in case anyone has this issue.\n\nALSO: This shows the importance of an emergency fund! I am not worried about my paycheck not depositing because I have the money set aside for this exact situation.

{"question":"Returning to offices to boost the CBD economy Howdy Ausfinancers, I\u2019ve been noticing a slow rise in companies getting people back into offices - coupled with LinkedIn posts from corporations, painting a picture of excited anticipation by employees on not having to work from \u201chome offices\u201d anymore. \n\nIn my view, these kinds of rhetoric paint a heavily biased, one-sided view of a subset of employees that prefer working from an office as opposed to working from home. I\u2019ve heard a lot of anecdotal reasoning indicating that a big drive for the return to office is stimulating the economy of small businesses in the CBD. \n\nI\u2019m interested in knowing the opinions of this subreddit regarding the above - while I understand the economic benefit of having more people in the city, is the onus really on us to supplement small business economy in cities as opposed to locally\/ regionally? Is the overarching sentiment favouring a return to offices, or is this a corporate agenda?\n\nMy take here is - Corporations painting a picture that employees prefer the commute\/ return to office smells eerily like propaganda to me, and I don\u2019t agree with having to travel to the city to support small businesses when I\u2019m much more productive and happy working from home, and being a regular patron of local small businesses for my morning coffee and lunches. \n\nTL;DR - how keen are you all to return to offices, and how much responsibility do you feel you owe towards supporting small businesses in the city by giving up WFH privileges? What\u2019s your take on the rising corporate messaging re: the return to office?","answer":"Yes as a CBD office worker, I resent essentially being deemed as consumption expenditure for CBD businesses.

That\u2019s a good thing, maybe local communities will rise again. \n\nI\u2019m firmly of the view that the hybrid arrangement is the future for many white collar jobs.

{"question":"CCIP-021 - Temporarily sort comments by newest first after a post is submitted. **Summary:** This proposal is for sorting comments by newest first after a post is submitted. The intended goal is to level the playing field between early bird low-effort comments and more meaningful high-effort comments by limiting visibility for the former.\n\n**Problem Statement:** After a post is submitted, the first comments tend to be low-effort. Most of them are simple trite remarks or jokes about the parent post which tend not to offer much originality or value. Users who make these comments are probably only seeking attention or farming moons and often receive numerous upvotes just for being first. Users who make more meaningful comments first take time to even notice the post and additional time to write a comment.\n\n**Solution:** After a submission has been posted, temporarily set the suggested comment sorting to newest first. After 30 minutes(more or less), the suggested sorting will be switched to top comments first. This change should give later comments an advantage over early comments. It might also encourage users to post more top-level comments and therefore increase the odds of triggering a discussion, since every comment will be treated the same for a set amount of time. The 30 minute time limit will be tweaked by the mod team for optimization.\n\n**Concerns:** The first two items in the following list are concerns given by u\/CryptoMaximalist in the [r\/CryptoCurrencyMeta thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrencyMeta\/comments\/p0xprp\/idea_for_the_first_few_hours_comment_sorting_is\/hdqrwkp) which I have paraphrased. The last one is mine.\n\n* Hiding comment scores for a longer period of time may be considered as an alternative method or additional measure for achieving this goal. However, this idea would have to be submitted as a separate proposal. Currently, scores are hidden for 5 minutes. Contest mode is a controlled option for hiding scores, but it also collapses lower-level comments and might hamper discussion.\n\n* Many Reddit clients do not respect suggested sorting and allow the user to override them.\n\n* My own minor concern would be the potential for incentivizing more spam in the top-level comments since farmers would be fighting for visibility. Rate-limits might be required.\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/qhc2k1)","answer":"I see some problems here.\n\n1. The discussion in a lot of posts are not active after 30 minutes, it'll get only a few comments after this time and that's it. Even if someone writes a good comment, he won't get the upvotes he deserves just because he won't be visible, most people will just go to newer posts.\n\n\n2. Someone writes a comment, then downvotes everyone, 30 minutes pass, he's at the top for new viewers.\n\n3. Let's imagine, there are 30 comments in this 30M period, a user will have to read them all to decide which are the best but what's more likely he'll read only 5-10 at the top and the most useful comment can be right in the bottom. \n\nI don't see how this poll solves anything. It'd be more useful if comments were randomized for every viewer than just sorted by new.\n\nEdit: I read that it's not possible to get it randomized, then I don't see any point in it."}

The current yield is close to 10%.\n\nI am late to the investing game and with two young kids don\u2019t really have the time to fully dig in. \n\nI see most people are big on SCHD and would be interested to know the major differences between the two. \n\nAppreciate any thoughts!","answer":"ETO looks like a yield trap. A 10% yield is not a good thing, it's a huge warning sign. High chance that dividend will be reduced soon. I know you feel like it's too late and you're so far behind that you will never catch up, but trust me, trying to solve that by chasing risky high yield stocks will just cause you to lose all your money, and in the end, set you back further.\n\nStart your portfolio with $10k in SCHD and the next $10k in VTI or VOO. Yeah the yields seem low, but they will more likely than not increase the dividend paid out each year. Plus, you will also be getting capital gains as the value of the underlying shares of these ETFs increase. If you think you don't have the time to watch the compounding effect take hold, speed it up by getting a second job to boost your savings rate each month. Further boost returns by cutting back on costs so that you can have more money to put into your *safe* investments."}
{"question":"I was renting for 1300 per month, and just bought a house with 2k mortgage payments and I'm feeling stressed. Edit: Thanks everyone for your advice and words of encouragement. I didn't expect to get so many responses, I really appreciate all your help! \n\nWe just bought a house last week and feeling stressed by the change in living expenses. I'm hoping for some affirmation that we will be alright. Here's our info:\n\nWe are a family of 4 (two adults and two toddlers who are both 2.5 years old). We have a net income of 108,000 per year. After contributing to retirement accounts, and also taxes and health insurance - we take home about 6k per month. We have about 30k in a savings\/checking accounts and 60k in retirement accounts. \n\nWe have no debt, but we do pay 1600 per month for childcare, 80 dollars per month in car insurance, 100 for phones, 80 for Internet. Our childcare cost will go down to 1300 per month starting in September and in 1.5 years it will drop down to only 800 per month.\n\nWe have been renting an apartment for 1,300 per month for the past 5 years, but just bought a house. Our mortgage payments including homeowners insurance, mortgage insurance, property taxes, etc is 2,077 dollars per month. \n \nOur mortgage payment is about 1\/3 of our take home money, but I'm still feeling really stressed since it is such a large increase from the rent we were paying. \n\nOur rationale in buying the house was that the apartment was way too small for the kids, and if we rented a house in our area, it would have been about 500 more per month than our mortgage. Also, as rent keeps going up, I think the cost of renting our apartment within 5 years will be 2k per month, so the house is a good long term plan.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation? Even if we ended up losing all our income, we would be alright for a few years (not that we are forseeing that happening but it helps for my peace of mind).","answer":"Keep doing what you\u2019re doing. The stress you feel is normal and, dare I say, healthy even. Taking the responsibility seriously will force you to make good decisions and keep the long term view in mind when you act. After a while, you\u2019ll come to terms with your financial options and the mortgage will just become something you\u2019ve gotten used to."}
{"question":"Parents close to retirement age looking to invest 150k into dividend paying ETFs, suggestions? My folks make a great income from their (almost) passive business which will continue now that they are getting close to retirement age.\n\nThey have about 150k from their cash that they would like to earn some dividends on. Products such as ZWC and VDY seem appealing. \n\nObviously growth here is not the primary goal and they don't really need that 150k anytime soon. I think they'd like a nice little recurring paycheck from it. They're not interested in picking individual stocks.\n\nSuggestions?","answer":"Labrador iron ore in Canada. They\u2019ve been paying dividends for 75+ years as well as a bonus dividend at the end of the year usually. They\u2019re currently trading at $45.43\/share. They pay $4.00\/share. Solid company.

{"question":"$325,000 HELOC - How would you invest it? I was just approved for a $325,000 HELOC through PenFed on an investment property. I will likely get the funds within 60-90 days. The rate is 4.75% (1.5% above prime), first 10 year interest only option, then it goes to a 20 year fixed. I currently own 2 houses (one primary residence and one investment), my wife and I have no debt besides our 2 mortgages and now this HELOC.\n\nI would like to buy a triplex or fourplex, somewhere in the midwest (Ohio, Michigan) or perhaps Little Rock, AR. I would like to try to BRRR remotely, as I live in the Seattle area. Is this feasable? Or should I go for something more turnkey?\n\nRegarding the HELOC - I would use it to buy a property outright for somewhere around $100K - $150K, and then use some of the remaining funds for renovations. Then, I would do a cash out refinance, get a 30 year fixed mortgage and repay the HELOC and repeat.\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes? How would you approach this differently? Thanks.","answer":"I would not try to BRRR remotely. You're just asking for trouble. BRRR really depends on strong local contracting relationships who can get things done quickly and at a low cost. Doing so remotely will be extremely difficult. I would personally advise you to keep your investments centralized and in the same area."}
{"question":"People who went through 2008, was there any signs? What was the sentiment like before the crisis? The S&amp;P500 doubled within 5 years up until 2007. I imagine the sentiment must of been bullish, until it wasn't. Was the media predicting a rejection from the 2000's top\/ calling a recession? Were the issues with home loans being highlighted like corporate debt is today?\n\nI'm curious because today economists are calling for growth slow downs and a recession within the next few years, but as we know economists rarely get it right.","answer":"There were a few that were highlighting the mortgage crisis. But it was in no way like it is today, where everyone is expecting a pull back. My thinking is that that\u2019s a positive. If so many people are expecting a pull back then it\u2019s likely that people are not as fully invested so a mass sell off will be less impactful than a complete surprise, like it was in 08. "}

{"question":"What to do with cash that isn't mine? Good morning UKPF,\n\nWith the discontinuation of paper \u00a320 notes, my father recently brought to my attention that he keeps a significant amount of cash under his bed (nothing illegal, just doesn't trust banks). The problem is that he is ninety-something, tells his neighbours and nurses about his stash and is extremely stubborn. Despite this, he has said that I can move the cash somewhere safer as long as he doesn't have to do anything.\n\nI have already okayed it with my bank if I were to bring a bunch of cash in but I am just wondering how such a deposit might affect me in terms of tax, etc. because I do not consider the money mine and when my father eventually passes it will be split 50\/50 with my sister. I can't split it immediately because my sister won't accept any money until my father has passed. Furthermore I would like the money to be fairly accessible should my father ask for it.\n\nI have considered a safety deposit box and premium bonds in my name or even just a separate account in my name but the fact still remains that the initial transaction of depositing it into my bank will still show up on my statements.\n\nIf anyone has any information on how this would affect me with regards to HMRC or advice on the best way to keep his money safe, I would really appreciate it.\n\nHave a lovely day.\n\nThank you.","answer":"Note: that cash will be subject to inheritance tax if he dies within the next 7 years, and he passes it onto you in his estate. You can gift money to your children in lump sums because every UK citizen has an annual tax-free gift allowance of \u00a33,000 - anything above that is subject to inheritance tax + tax free allowances.\n\nI would just deposit it into your dad's account - you can just deposit it into the machine with his card (if he is happy to give his details), and then withdraw it again if he wants to keep it as physical cash.\n\nHow much is it?"}
{"question":"If it's later determined that the DTCC prevented the MOASS until they could get these new rules in place, could they be sued for market manipulation? Serious question. While the delay of MOASS has allowed me and numerous others to up my position numerous times, it has undoubtedly lead to some people reducing positions due to unexpected bills\/needs. There have been a number of theories discussing the possibility that the MOASS is currently being prevented in order to reduce the chance of a market crash while the DTCC gets these new rules in place.\n\nSo my question is simple... Preventing anything from happening naturally in the market is manipulation. What's to stop GameStop, participants, other entities from filing suits if it's determined that they did indeed delay MOASS until they were ready for it?","answer":"Was thinking the same thing last night. I'm guessing the only way you would have standing is to be able to prove some sort of opportunity loss. Perhaps you sold some before the MOASS or find a way to say because of the delay, there were things that you missed out on. Not a lawyer, however."}
{"question":"Just an observation at a job with part time and full time hourly employees. I know for a lot of people this is a given but I work an hourly job and I am still surprised by some of the snap judgements that I hear. There are always a handful of people who are trying to get work as much as they can, they will make themselves as available as possible and try and cover shifts for other people as much as possible. They often aren\u2019t shy about how they need money and might not be in the best place at the time. \n\nWhat shocks me is when they aren\u2019t able to take a shift I\u2019ll hear chatter about how \u201cthey must not actually need money that much\u201d or \u201cthey have their nails done\/are drinking Starbucks\/etc. so obviously their financial situation isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d\n\nWhat people don\u2019t always realize is maybe this person hasn\u2019t had a weekend day off in months. Maybe this person has a significant milestone that day. Maybe this person was given a Starbucks gift card and couldn\u2019t sell it. Maybe their nails are always done because that\u2019s the once a month get together they have with their mom and she pays for it. \n\nI get where the skepticism comes from but it\u2019s always important to remember things aren\u2019t what they seem, and people deserve to have days reserved to be off no matter what their financial situation is. You never know the backstory to everything so be kind. Assuming the worst doesn\u2019t help anyone in these situations. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is redundant to you. I just needed to get this off my chest and I hope that it may help somebody out there.","answer":"I used to work as a cashier when I was a teen at a grocery store in Chicagoland. I had a regular who would come in and always pick my line and we'd chit-chat. She paid for most of her order with food stamps. Occasionally one of her kids would try and sneak a candy bar or a toy or a sugary cereal into the pile and as she was a regular I knew her usual purchases and would fish out the unexpected items and make sure she knew about them. Sometimes she said it was fine, kid had had a good week at school, or sometimes she would say no and put it back. \n\nOnce she came in by herself and got way less stuff than usual but she also had lobster tails. I called it out as I was ringing stuff up in case her kids had snuck it in and she quietly said it was her husband's birthday, she had no money for a gift but he was working two jobs and she wanted to do something nice for him. I don't think anyone heard her but me. I continued ringing and some lady in line behind her started complaining that she was using stamps for lobster. The customer got pale and looked so upset.  I told my regular that it was ok, I understood, and finished my transaction with her and told her to have a nice day. \n\n\"Unfortunately\" after I finished the transaction my register jammed, I couldn't figure it out after trying for a good long while. Gosh, it was hard to concentrate with the complaining lady staring at me. The line was building up behind her. But I was sure I'd have it fixed real soon. Eventually, I had to have the manager come over, key in, and sort things out. The manager had seen what happened and seemed to also have some trouble with the key process; we had to open another register, get a new cash drawer, count it and set up so we could move her stuff over and ring her up. So unfortunate."}
{"question":"What is the purpose of PovertyFinance? I joined \/r\/PovertyFinance hoping to 1) discover things that are useful for people in poverty and 2) enjoy hearing\/sharing stories of the struggle and successes of people in poverty for encouragement\/wisdom.\n\nSeems the only things that make the front page are images of paid off student loans and images of credit scores. In general, these things aren\u2019t very helpful. Most people can\u2019t even implement the methods in such posts... e.g., get a job paying 80k\/year, live with parents, etc... because they are unattainable for most.\n\nI would rather someone post about how to find ways to save money or stay sane... For example, my wife and I saved tons of money buying baby things on the Facebook marketplace. I highly recommend over Craigslist.\n\nEdit: As I keep mentioning in the comments (and pointed out above), people should post their successes. We want to see people escape poverty, but a post of an image of bank account, paid off debt, credit score, etc... is useless without the story. Most often, the story goes untold along with these type of posts.","answer":"I feel like it didn't used to be this way.

I am happy to do it but I am worried about taking on liability if I give any advice on insurance or investing.  I am experienced and confident I can help but I am not in any way licenced for that (I do financial and controlling I.T. work).  Am I being paranoid in thinking there might be some risk?  Is there anything I can do to protect myself that would easy to do?\n\nEdit:  Thanks to everyone who responded.  You have given some good advice on pitfalls to avoid and pretty much confirmed our instincts.  ","answer":"You aren't collecting money from these people correct? There is no contract? So long as you don't suggest they invest in something you have a controlling stake or would make a gain from (like a commission or referral) I don't see any issue.  \n\nAnother avenue would be to try and locate a financial planner that speaks their language, comes from their country, or their parents did and they still have strong ties to that culture."}
{"question":"Women's products Why are women's products so much more expensive than men's? I can somewhat understand clothing being more expensive. But razors, bags, coats, scarves, gloves, deodorant, pads and tampons are so expensive too for women.\n\nAnd, furthermore, pads and tampons are something that we women need for years. It's not like it's something we can just ignore, it's part of our biology. I've seen it go to $5-$10 to all the way to $20. It is just mind-boggling to me and nothing is being done about it, no one is even really talking about it. Or if they are, not very often.\n\nEdit: To the people who comment, buy the cheaper version. Of course, buy the cheaper version. That's not the issue here. The issue here is that one product is more expensive than another, even though they're the same basic product, just marketed towards the other gender.\n\nAlso: Pads and Tampons are not luxury items like companies claim. They are completely necessary items that we need for the next odd years. It's not our fault, our biology is different from a man's. I'm not necessarily saying that they should be free, but they definitely should be cheaper than what they are currently.","answer":"I'm sure someone will comment at some point about reusable menstrual products.

They probably would have worked for someone with less heavy cycles. It helps to have access to a washing machine in your living space too. There was a bucket with a lid next to the toilet for two weeks or more of each month. I usually ran out before the end of cycle and ended up washing some by hand. \n\nThe manufacturers blame us women for this whole thing. \"They buy it so they must want this.\" If my choices are something generic or something pink, there'd better be a damn good reason for choosing the expensive ugly pink option over the basic \"men's\" version.

I've always been responsible, with finances, with relationships, with career development, with family. \nHowever, I'm near over the hill and have this gnawing feeling of doing something a bit (and I stress just a bit) impulsive, irresponsible- seems like a MINI midlife crisis to me.  My understanding is that this is normal and can last anywhere from 6 months to 2 years.  Thought I'd ask the sub if there were any small impulse buys that any of you did around this age.  I'm not talking about a new house or lambo, but something awesome, memorable until this feeling goes away.  \n\nNote that I'm talking to a therapist about this, but also looking at indulging or doing something impulsive.

Pool Together ([https:\/\/www.pooltogether.us](https:\/\/www.pooltogether.us\/)) is a \"no-loss lottery\" where people can buy entry tickets with DAI. The DAI then gets pooled together and lent out. After a short period of time all of the original DAI is returned to its original owners and one lucky winner gets all of the interest generated by the pool. 13,155 tickets were sold in the most recent pool leading to a current estimated reward of nearly 400 DAI.\n\n2.) Guesser ([https:\/\/guesser.com](https:\/\/guesser.com\/)) is basically a UI for Augur that doesn't suck. I'm actually not sure if it's difficult to interact directly with the Augur platform anymore, but it definitely was when I first tried. This looks like a much more user-friendly way for people to get introduced to decentralized prediction markets.\n\n3.) Pinata ([https:\/\/pinata.cloud\/](https:\/\/pinata.cloud\/)) is an \"IPFS pinning service\" that makes decentralized web hosting super easy (and free if you have less than 1GB of content data!) No need to run your own node or worry about an unreliable internet connection making your data unavailable - Pinata handles everything with an intuitive web interface.\n\n4.) Gods Unchained ([https:\/\/godsunchained.com\/](https:\/\/godsunchained.com\/)) isn't exactly \"new\" but I did discover that the marketplace for cards will be available soon. From everything I've seen so far, this looks like it will be the biggest speculative NFT market on any blockchain ever shortly after the marketplace launches.\n\n5.) MetaMask Mobile is finally out! It includes a wallet &amp; web3 browser so I'll probably be uninstalling the Opera mobile beta pretty soon. ;)\n\n6.) Brave Mobile Ads exist now, too! Earning BAT is not just for desktop users anymore. It might end up being a stupid plan, but I'm going to be converting all of my BAT into Gods Unchained cards. Hearthstone is the only game that I have time for in my life anymore, and I've always been really bummed that it didn't include some sort of trading functionality. Hearth &amp; MTG:A are great, but at the end of the day I feel like my collections are essentially worthless.\n\nWell, that's pretty much all I've been checking out this week! :) Anyone like any of these projects, too?\n\nEdit: Just gonna toss in a shameless self-promotion here since that's kinda what this thread is all about!

Why? because knowledge is power, thats why.\n\n[The three major brain divisions.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8w5b0c3e36t61.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa44c97b2a3d114fe2938dbca4c31f4def60e25b)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe brain is broken into three parts:\n\n1. *Primal brain* (Basal Ganglia) - hindbrain\n2. ***Emotional brain*** **(Limbic System) - midbrain**\n3. ***Rational brain*** **(Neocortex) - forebrain**\n\nGuess what? Your limbic system and neocortex are constantly communicating but they can only communicate in one direction at a time. Please allow me to introduce you to top-down and bottom-up processing.\n\n[Top-down and bottom-up structural processes.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hu9ima1496t61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86b320942ac69fe72eef9abee192e6710a985946)\n\nRight, so do you want to think like a predator ready to take down a HF or a paper-handing prey? Oh you say predator? Well then listen the f up.\n\nYour limbic system is responsible for all your feelies while your neocortex is responsible for managing those feelies.\n\nWhen we are excited or scared, our brain goes into a 'fight or flight' response which operates on bottom-up processing. In simple words, if you become excited or scared during the MOASS (a likely response) then you may be irrational and could act on impulse.\n\nNo one wants to be, and no one wants you to be, an irrational ape during the MOASS. So it looks like your feelings really do matter (and fuck anyone who tells you they don't. no seriously, fuck them).\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo whats the goal then? To keep your brain logical through top-down processing so you and everyone else can enjoy the MOASS.\n\nThere are 3 approaches to this and each of them is part of preparing:\n\n1. Learn.\n2. Desensitize.\n3. Self management.\n\nRead the damn DD. Read up on exit strategies (listen up smooth brains, this is not a normal stock and traditional exit strategies may not be useful so do your DD or find someone else's). The more you know the more rational you are. This goes for your big bwain and its feelies too, learn how it works so you can be the best teammate you have ever known.\n\nFind creative ways to alter your current environment\/thinking to resemble a MOASS scenario. Look at tickers with BIG numbers. Write down the varying amounts you can make. Discuss floors that seem impossible but are in-fact very plausible (a.k.a. 1 million). Buy a pet snake then mail it to Ken.\n\nStart familiarizing yourself with calming techniques and exit strategies. Start practicing those techniques when you are already calm so your brain knows what to do when euphoria hits. For example, if your practice deep breathing right now when MOASS is not wrecking havoc (in the best way) on your nervous system, then when MOASS does hit and you go, \"ok time for a big bweath meow,\" your brain will go, \"oh shit ok! we practiced this! I know what to do! I need to be calm and rational so I can make smart decisions about when to exit!!\"\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlright, time for a MF MOASS LEVEL UP!!!\n\nFirst off, you deserve this. That little FUD voice in your head saying you don't has no idea how much you deserve this. Show it that you do. Show yourself that you are worthy of reward.\n\nSecond off, all you &lt;10 share holders, you are the back bone of this community. Thank you! The majority of this community is made of people holding &lt;10 shares and it would not be what it is without you. Your ability to hodl is superior and don't you forget it. You matter. Your shares matter. Your reward matters.\n\nI'm not writing third off (oops just did) because it sounds wierd. This post would be trash if I was not giving you resources so here they are. Now you can complete your MOASS level up.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLinks for self management:\n\n[Reminders for Managing Behaviour](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/lzxbzm\/be_adamant_some_reminders_for_managing_behavior\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) by u\/oaf_king (warrior mentality, LOVE IT)\n\n[Psychological Warfare](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/mhxmra\/psychological_warfare_strap_up_apes\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) by u\/Strength-Overall (be better than your dopamine folks)\n\n[MOASS SOS](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/mdnohu\/repost_therapeutic_techniques_for_managing_during\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) by me.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLinks for addressing bag holding FUD:\n\n[Anatomy of a Short Squeeze](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/mos6zf\/anatomy_of_a_short_squeeze_and_why_no_ape_will_be\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) by u\/franciscogil90 (A seriously good read.

For those who have read the DD there will be little doubt in the possibility, but like you said, many have worked hard to get a few shares as those guys are important. They (myself included in this) are not used to having lots of money, or dealing in big numbers. I worked my way up from 1 banana to more bananas than I thought possible when I first put skin in the game. I will hold because the banana I have won\u2019t impact my life greatly if the price doubles or even quadruples. It would provide some luxury for a few months. Im in this for a BIG life changing payout and I will hold my shares until that happens. I can say that now while my shares are in the red, but I think it will be more difficult when they are lots of very green bananas on the way up. However, I\u2019m gonna hold, and I\u2019m thankful for the advice you have given because you are right: my brain is in (currently) programmed to be rich, but I\u2019m gonna practice, using your suggestions, so that I am ready when the time comes!"}
{"question":"Am I right that we (Turkey) might be on the verge of a housing bubble? So as you might have heard our currency lost about 15% of its value on one day. Right now everyone is scrambling to get rid of \u20ba cash and the most popular instrument to do so here seems to be real estate, maybe along with gold and USD\/euros.\n\nWith the CBRT reducing interest rates, the public banks have followed suit with reducing housing loan rates to ridiculously low levels around 0.70% yearly but private banks haven't. Something similar had happened last year also with rates lower than 0.70% with government subsidies in housing purchases.\n\nLast week data came in that said loan defaults increased 150%. Especially public banks are scrambling to give loans to everyone. They literally call people earning minimum wage and try to give them housing loans more than 10x their yearly income.\n\nThe result of all this is that houses have sold like hot cakes since 2020. House prices have nearly doubled in one year. But no one is living in these houses. In 2018-2019 we had tens of thousands of empty houses that could not be sold. Now we apparently have a housing shortage.\n\nAmidst all these my parents are considering buying a house for investment. I said that's not very rational right now. Am I right to be concerned?","answer":"Yes, this is a classic bubble, inflation and low interest rates are going to pump huge amounts of money into housing. \n\n&gt; They literally call people earning minimum wage and try to give them housing loans more than 10x their yearly income.\n\nSame thing happened right before the 2008 housing crash in the US.\n\n&gt; Amidst all these my parents are considering buying a house for investment. I said that's not very rational right now. Am I right to be concerned?\n\nDepends on how bad the inflation gets. If Turkey goes full-bore hyperinflation, then you just want to get rid of your money anywhere you can, housing or otherwise. Housing might not be a great investment, but if the alternative is holding a hyperinflating currency, the house is probably better."}
{"question":"Who's on the other side of credit card debt? Credit card debt has reached record highs. Who's holding that debt? Is it the banks that issue the cards - or do they package it up into Collateralized Credit Card Obligations - or what?","answer":"Usually it is banks. Unsecured debt like credit-card debt is usually not packaged into bonds.\n\nYou are right that credit-card debt is at record highs in *nominal terms*. But if you adjust for inflation then it's only at ~2017 levels and has not yet reached the pre-pandemic high. That is if you adjust for the fact that money is worth considerably less now compared to pre-pandemic times they you see that so is credit-card debt."}
{"question":"Selling a house. I've heard that the real estate agent starts to work against you the moment you sign the contract. How do I do well through this? How do I establish my bottom price? (If course i won't tell agent). How do I know when to take an offer or keep the place on the market? What are the tricks do I need to be aware of? \nExperiences welcome\nHouse is in middle ring Brisbane. ","answer":"They don't work against you per se. The agent's incentive is to sell your house as quickly as possible for as little work on their part. The price they get for the house barely affects their commision so they now have an incentive to convince you to accept a lower price and complete the sale. Before you accept them as your agent they will tell you it's their job to get the buyer to pay more, which is only half the story. What they don't tell you is that it's equally their job to get the seller to agree to accept less. The agent's whole job is to bridge the gap between the amount the buyer wants to pay and the amount the seller will accept. Whether they bridge that gap from the bottom, from the top, or both, makes absolutely no difference to them. "}

{"question":"New unemployment benefits are crazy good. People making $50k or less will actually see an increase in income if laid off. So is the concern over tenants not being able to pay rent way overblown? https:\/\/thehill.com\/opinion\/finance\/490476-the-2-trillion-relief-package-makes-unemployment-pay-more-than-work\n\nNow I'm in a LCOL metro so this wont apply to everyone. My tenants pay $500-$750 per month for rent. With these new unemployment benefits I'm not seeing why layoffs should result in them being unable to pay rent. Many of them will see their income temporarily increase so I see no viable excuse for them not paying. Is anyone else not really concerned about collecting rent given the boost to unemployment payments?","answer":"https:\/\/www.nolo.com\/legal-encyclopedia\/unemployment-benefits-amount-duration-32447.html\n\nYou should rely a little less on an outlet with a clear political agenda for financial advice.\n\nYou don\u2019t just immediately get the maximum state unemployment benefit. \n\nYou have no idea what your tenants will receive beyond the $600 from the Fed, and you\u2019re assuming they will get that money in a timely fashion."}
{"question":"Poor-Man's Budgeting Spreadsheet Well first off let me preface this with \"This is not your long-term solution to your financial problems\" BUT if you are living paycheck to paycheck (i.e. you really have no money to put aside) then this may help you with your daily budgeting.\n\nA while ago I came across an interesting budgeting method here on reddit that goes somewhere along the lines of \"substract all your expenses from your income and then divide what is left over by the amount of day and spend only your daily budget, which stacks...\" which sounds very convoluted and hard to keep track of. So I made this spreadsheet to do the work for you!\n\nIt's on google docs so you can simply \"**File -&gt; Make a copy**\" to your own google docs and then work with that. (Why google docs?

Why is so much money spent on keeping it's price suppressed?

{"question":"Purchasing or renting a house? My fianc\u00e9 and I are very torn between purchasing or renting. We are both fairly young to purchase a home, which is our biggest hesitation (24 &amp; 25). We are both debt free. I currently have $100,000 saved and my fianc\u00e9 has ~$55,000 with an income of $65,000 a year. The area we are looking is in\/around Greenville, SC. It is becoming a very popular place to move\/live. My fianc\u00e9's family has lived here his whole life, and his parents did something similar to what we are thinking of doing. They bought land a little further out than where most people were living, and now the population has expanded and they have had a great investment. We found a property that has a pretty nice home on it, and is 6 acres. The property mortgage would be ~$1,300 a month. The places we are looking to rent are ~$2,000 a month (we have a dog and there are less places that accept pets). \n\nWe both feel it would be a better investment to buy land and live in the home on it, then one day build our own house on the property. We are also both terrified of taking out a mortgage or being in debt.

I don\u2019t deny those points - like everything I believe there is a mix. I fondly remember the actual discussions with folks who fully subscribed to the  (American) dream - these have become fewer with time.

{"question":"First month of Thetagang. Results \/ Lessons Learned \/ Help from the Community **Background:** 36 years old, married, 3 kids, Manager role at work typical 9-5 job.\n\nHave a sizable amount of liquid funds sitting idle. I personally believe the market is extremely overextended, after going literally straight up for 10+ years. Realizing that markets can stay irrational for much longer due to the fed pumping liquidity and low interest rates, I figured I can start to dabble into the wheel strategy.\n\nI started over Christmas break reading a bunch about the wheel strategy and found this subreddit. Watched a bunch of videos on YouTube to get educated. Many thanks to youtuber Inthemoney, I found his content the most intuitive to understand. At first the theta strategy seemed way over my head, but after watching and reading things over and over it started to come together.\n\nOver the week of Jan 4th I started to deposit funds from my bank account to ToS. I did a few deposits totaling $95k. It took a little bit for the funds to settle for options trading, so figure I had all funds ready by Jan 10th.\n\n**Strategy**: My primary trading strategy is selling CSP\u2019s, 30-45 days out with the objective of not getting assigned. I\u2019m still getting my bearings, but I\u2019ve tried to sell deep OTM puts on good underlying\u2019s. Targeting 20ish delta.

So far its working well, but could be better. Anyone recommend other indicators that work well? I also found weekly expected move for doing FD\u2019s.\n\n**Results:** After 1 month  Start: 95,000k.

Here are the ones that hopefully the new users don\u2019t make.\n\n**(1)** Not legging into a trade. Let\u2019s be honest, timing a trade perfectly is almost impossible. If you know you want to trade 10 contracts on an underlying. Nothing worse than going all in and next day you are -20%.\n\n**(2)** Chasing a tanking stock. UWMC crew represent. I kept adding CSP\u2019s to this piece of shit stock and it continued to tank. I could have used those funds on other stocks that could have actually made me money. At the peak, I had 45 contracts, accounting for almost 50% of my account. UWMC went up intraday a week or so ago and I was able to get out of the trade flat. From now on, I can sleep well at night knowing 1 or 2 contracts are -75%.\n\n**Help from the group**\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**(1)** I am really struggling with letting time work its thing with CSPs. I seem to get to 20% profits decently quickly on my trades, sometimes with 35-30 days left to expire and close. I get antsy and move on to something else. My trades are going well, and I fear jumping into something else and it turn into a bad trade and turn the prior winning trade into a wash. How do I break this habit?\n\nIn addition, I think I fuel this habit by frequently  open all my trades at once (with exact DTE), and close all at once. I need to turn it opening a few at different times, which will result in closing at different times as the options get to 20 DTE.\n\n**(2)** Since starting thetagang, I\u2019m tending to hawk over my account constantly.

(yes it's very sad, thank you for your sympathy, let's not focus on that part)\n\nI don't know what to do with my money and I'm not sure whether referring to the flowchart is going to be helpful given my unusual circumstances. The insanity of 2020 has meant financial stuff all got away from me and I've incurred a number of substantial and unexpected expenses. The dust is now settling and I am finally trying to sit down and have a think about the way forward. I will sum up the situation as concisely as I can:\n\n* I currently have \u00a345k, \u00a312k of which is in a maxed HTB ISA, the remainder of which is in low-interest savings accounts\n* I make ~\u00a340k\/yr in a secure job, am still working full time, and intend to continue for as long as possible\n* My expenses are zero (I live with my parents)\n* I have no debts of any kind\n* I do not own any property and have no meaningful assets bar this money\n* I am projected to live for somewhere between (worst case) a couple of months to (_extremely_ optimistically) 5 years. The average lifespan of someone in my position I am told is 1-2 years\n* My sole objective is to leave as much money as possible behind for my family\n\nI'm aware you can apply for certain benefits if you are terminally ill, but I understand that you do not get them unless your oncologist is confident you will die within 6 months, which mine isn't. I am thinking about buying a cheap house to realise the extra \u00a33k from the HTB ISA but I don't know if that would be more trouble than it's worth and\/or would end up losing me money anyway given the current housing market.\n\nPrimarily I am trying to figure out what to do with the money I have that is just lying around not doing anything, and what to do with my monthly after-tax income of ~\u00a32.5k. There has to be something more productive it can do than earn 0.7% AER in a Goldman Sachs Marcus. From consulting the flowchart, if I were healthy, it seems the recommendation would be S&amp;S ISA + low cost global index trackers? Should I just do that on the understanding that the ownership of any investments I have can be transferred to my next of kin when I die?\n\nI would welcome any advice anyone has.\n\nedit: Everyone has said some variation of \"spend the money on doing whatever will make you happy\". This is a totally understandable sentiment :) I've had this talk with my family and really there isn't much left I both want to do and can do (COVID-19 + chemo means I basically cannot leave the house). Rest assured I will use some of the money to buy a Nintendo Switch or something, but the #1 thing that will make me happy is ensuring my family will be OK financially after I am gone.","answer":"You sound like an amazing person, for what its worth.\n\nIMO a S&amp;S ISA or a property would just be a headache you don't need - they're both usually something that'll take 5+ years to be worthwhile.

But what I can do is tell you what I'd do if it were mine:\n\n* I'd dump \u00a350k of it in premium bonds and hope I win the million. Write a will to leave the premium bonds and any winnings to your family.\n* You've then got \u00a37k left to enjoy the rest of your time however you see fit.

If each mortgaged property is cash flowing $200\/month, then I would need 20 properties to reach my goal.  \n\nBut if those homes each cash flow $1000\/month after they're paid off, then wouldn't it be easier to just acquire 4 properties and then pay them off aggressively?

{"question":"can (and have) monopolies exist in a free market? Here by free market I mean what the Austrian School refers to as a free market, one that is free from government regulation and controls. I have often heard libertarian capitalist economists say that in a market free from government intervention there will exist perfect competition and thus no one company will be able to gain a too dominant share of the market in any given sector. Also arguing that any disequilibrium in the economy caused by monopolies would lead to entrepreneurship to counter such market failures in a free market.\n\nI'm not entirely convinced by this line of argument as I can see potentially for natural monopolies to form via luck or simply getting places first then engaging in predatory pricing and fluctuating prices to utilise their economies of scale to drive out would be competition.\n\nIs there a general consensus on the topic?","answer":"Austrian \u201ceconomists\u201d are ideologues entirely untroubled by reality. The idea that markets would tend towards perfect competition in the absence of regulation is pure fantasy without any empirical basis. Perfect competition is itself basically a fantasy that doesn\u2019t exist in the real world - the conditions are too onerous - no barriers to entry or exit, perfect information\u2026 these aren\u2019t realistic assumptions. As soon as you have any unique resources or capabilities or even economies of scale, you have market power and the construct collapses.\n\nThe assumption that new entrants will break up monopolies relies on the naive assumption that the monopolist won\u2019t respond to the emerging threat. Take an economies of scale example - the monopolist has a cost advantage over new entrants and the new entrants have to reach a minimum economic scale to be viable. If a new entrant threatens the incumbent, then they just need to cut prices temporarily below the costs of production of the new entrants, wait for them to go bust, then re-raise prices. They only need to crush a few new entrants before people learn not to challenge them. If you have competition authorities, they can take action against this type of behaviour &amp; foster competition, but in a zero regs world, monopolists have a free hand to crush their competitors."}
{"question":"Why exactly do economists dislike corporate taxes? ...and what would they propose to replace in order to raise revenues for the government? Would this amount be significantly more than purely corporate taxes? Why are they not simply taxed on gross income? How is it considered 'inefficient'?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have heard of a consumption tax, would this be something like Value Added Tax?","answer":"The reason economists don't like corporation tax is that it distorts investment in the economy. The very simple example is that if you imagine a firm has a profitable venture (\u03c0) with probability (p) of being successful and cost c to attempt, then the firm will invest if:\n\nE(\u03c0p)&gt;c\n\nAdding a tax distorts the left hand side of the equation and reduces the potential gains of the project being successful, and therefore stops firms from investing in otherwise profitable ventures. The reason this is bad is that all investment (savings) is for future consumption, and thus distorting investment (savings) function reduces consumption in the long run. It's also why a progressive consumption tax is popular among economists, because it causes the least distortion in behavior. Other popular taxes are pigovian taxes (ones that fix an externality) such as carbon taxes. Finally, another popular tax is a Land Value Tax."}

{"question":"The Benefits of Being Broke for a Decade It\u2019s interesting to me how spending a decade being broke and really struggling has been one of the biggest blessings in my life. \n\nAt the time it definitely didn\u2019t feel like that. Although these were generally happy times in my life, there\u2019s a lot of stress that can come from being broke.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been below the poverty level, but for about 5-6 years out of college I was earning 300\/wk waiting tables and later working at a pizza place. Started my own biz, made slightly more but not by much after that. Lived cheaper than I did in college while the biz was building up.\n\nHere I am maybe 3-4 years removed from being super broke and doing pretty good. I\u2019ve bought a few properties, got some money in the bank, hopefully some big things on the horizon, and an optimism about my financial life. \n\nSome things I\u2019ve noticed that have stayed with me from my broke decade:\n\n-Going out to eat is still a huge treat to me.\n\n-I became a pretty decent cook because I ate at home basically 34 meals a week.\n\n-I was driving a 3k car and am in a position to buy new, but I spent a little less than 9k and it felt like a HUGE upgrade.\n\n-I met my fianc\u00e9 when I was broke. She loved me then and still loves me now.\n\n-I learned to budget like a champ because there wasn\u2019t much room for error.\n\n-I learned I could still save money (pay myself first), and now I\u2019m saving at a high rate because I got in the habit when I was broke.\n\n-I learned that when I started GIVING a percentage of my pay (started at 1% and have worked up to 10%), I started making more and more.\n\n-I learned I was wrong to care so much about what people thought of me. I mean, I care now- but I want to be thought of as having high integrity, being reliable, being a good friend, partner, etc. I don\u2019t care if someone is impressed with the things I own or a job title. \n\n-I learned that spending money on books is a good investment. It\u2019s the learning that\u2019s taken place after school that\u2019s served me best from a financial standpoint.\n\n-Being forced to be frugal is very helpful if you\u2019re ever going to start a business. You\u2019ll know how to run things lean and mean instinctively.\n\n-my fixed living expenses have bumped up considerably. Maybe nearly 100%. 900-1000\/mo to 1800-2000\/mo. So, I feel like I\u2019m living pretty comfortably. Still, IMO that\u2019s living fairly lean and allowing me to save. I guess I\u2019m saying I learned to make intermediate jumps and not max out spending to the top of my budget with more money.\n\n\n-I think the most important part of spending a decade being broke was looking back on it and realizing I could go back to living on that $1,200\/mo if needed. Hopefully it won\u2019t happen because I have some goals that require money, but that is a really freeing feeling to know I can survive when things are lean. It gives me the confidence to push and take some risks- which has (so far) led to making more money.\n\n\nIf you spent a good amount of time being broke and are now on the upswing, what would you add to my list? What have you learned from looking back on that time?","answer":"This probably makes me a terrible person but as another guy that [was shamed throughout gradeschool for having to eat the free peanut butter sandwhiches for lunch] lived broke af for over a decade after highschool, I occasionally browse \/r\/homeless and \/r\/unemployed to remind me how fucking lucky I am."}

That\u2019d be like naked shorting or something!\n\n6:53 PM- Not enough petting zoo games. Would be a catalyst for sure I imagine.\n\n6:40 PM- GameStop is an anagram for Mage Tops.

I can\u2019t say much but I will tell you that a karate class down by the old KFC\/Taco Bell was involved. \n\n3:35 PM- Kid at the Build-a-Bear is screaming that his Tom Nook\u2019s nose is on crooked. Short attack?\n\n3:26 PM- Before locking myself in here, I asked Alice at the counter if I could buy some shares of GME. Was not success.\n\n3:10 PM- This bathroom also doubles as a storage room for extra Funko Pop figures which seems convenient and bullish.\n\n2:55 PM- Forgot my animal crackers in mom\u2019s car\n\n2:45 PM- Ok so Deke, who is the assistant manager claims something called \u201cNew Pok\u00e9mon Snap\u201d is coming out to a customer.

{"question":"IMPORTANT FOR NEW TRADERS: UNDERSTANDING HOW MARKET MAKERS WORK Given that there seems to be a large misconception of what market makers are, I felt it prudent to share some information. I often here the phrase \"the market makers just want to take your money and keep the stock away from $X price.\" This is inherently incorrect.\n\nMarket making is the identification of buyers and sellers with the intention of allowing them to consummate transactions. It is all done algorithmically.\n\nExchanges offer rebates to market makers in exchange for those market makers providing liquidity in different markets \u2013 they will pay MMs to hold short or long positions that provide liquidity in the market\n\n**Example:** A person wants to sell her stock for $51.00, but the current best offer (bid) is $49.00. If another market participant was desperate enough to purchase the stock, they would just move the bid to the ask. In this case, the liquidity provider is the participant who posted the $51.00 ask, meaning that they provided supply of that stock, which was sold.\n\nIf the algorithm decided that the fair price was $50.75 and the buyer was satisfied enough to purchase the asset at $50.75, the transaction would be consummated, and the seller would receive a rebate (in the form of a payment for their order flow)\n\nSome of this fee would come from the buyer (in the form of commissions, hence why when you hit the bid or ask, you are charged a higher fee with most brokerages, but when you leave your order open at the bid or ask and it is taken up on, you pay a lower commissions since you helped to provide liquidity)\n\nThere is essentially an algorithmic hunt for rebates occurring.\n\n[Diagram depicting Market Maker activity in a transaction](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h7mh5rifjem51.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f810d26d65dcf94e103e0d31cf86d90edb5bff0)\n\nIn the options markets, for instance, MMs are now holding the majority of the positions that buyers and sellers are trying to either accumulate or offload.\n\nThese market makers are much more important because of their size and due to their large positions, which they are required to hedge to maintain delta neutrality.\n\nGiven the institutional mindset, which is to generate income passively by selling call options or buying puts on SPY, for instance, a situation is created whereby market makers who are hedging are compressing volatility as markets move higher (hence why the VIX declines steadily into market rallies).\n\nConversely, **market makers cause exaggerated selloffs when the market declines, which is why markets fall so much faster than they tend to rise, because they rapidly attempt to hedge their positions that they are short on the way down.**\n\nMarket makers basically create pressure points in the market through their activities and they exert the most pressure when rapid moves occur, further amplifying these moves.\n\nSome of the largest market makers are: Virtu Financial, Citadel Securities, Two Sigma Securities, Susquehanna, Tower Research Capital, Jump Trading, DRW, Hudson River Trading, among others.\n\nHope you found this useful and Godspeed.","answer":"Pretty good explanation. I am a market maker.\n\n\nOne part I take some issue with is that we are there to match buyers and sellers, I think that much more aptly describes a broker (they get a buy order from a client and line up several market makers who want to sell). What option market makers actually do is warehouse risk, for a price (the spread). It\u2019s quite rare that we actually are able to flip contracts intraday because of the number of strikes and expirations, so instead we balance our books by trading different things and putting on spreads, not actually turning over the same contract over and over. \n\nAlso:  For what it\u2019s worth we see retail flow as basically free money. Yes that includes all of you. Even if you net tend to make money, and especially if you aren\u2019t hedging your Greeks properly. \n\nWhy is this?\n\nWe see options in terms of a volatility surface and relative mis pricings along that surface. *Everything is relative value to us* The reason we love retail flow is because retail usually has little idea of what the surface is let alone how to price it correctly and make sure they get the implied vol they seem to be fair for that option. Retail traders also trade in very small sizes and don\u2019t move markets (or if they do it\u2019s a wave of retail and we have time to hedge in between orders). 100 lot of SPY puts is basically nothing to us, for some sense of scale. Also, it\u2019s absolutely true that we want to take your money, that\u2019s our livelihood. It doesn\u2019t mean we wish you unwell but we take advantage of opportunities when we see them, if we didn\u2019t we wouldn\u2019t be in business very long. That said there are situations where we both win. Say you sell me a call and the stock goes down. Congratulations, you made money. I\u2019m hedged and if the implied volatility of the rises I\u2019ll make money even if the underlying goes down. In that sense the real loser is whoever bought the stock from me that I hedged with."}

{"question":"Day 5: I will post this guide regularly until available solutions like SegWit &amp; order batching are mass adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low. User demand from this community can help lead to some big changes. Have you joined the \/r\/Bitcoin SegWit effort? **SUMMARY**\n\nSegregrated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24, 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https:\/\/thewalletgenius.com\/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness\/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, some admitting in December 2017 that they have not even started work. If users demand SegWit now it will temporarily releive the transaction backlog while bigger solutions like Lightning are developed.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n**TODAY's NEWS\/DEVELOPMENTS\/VICTORIES**\n\n- [Conomi promises SegWit \"in a few days\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/7mhe33\/coinomi_we_are_releasing_segwit_in_a_few_days\/)\n- [Bitpanda implements Segwit!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/7m2sh9\/bitpanda_update_segwit_implementation_bitpanda\/)\n- [Pirate Bay provides a bech32 SegWit address](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/7m26vv\/the_pirate_bay_gets_it\/) Which one of you emailed them to request this ;)\n- [Spreading the message to Twitter: Daily Reminder: switch to segwit wallets and exchanges immediately](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/7m0y9h\/daily_reminder_switch_to_segwit_wallets_and\/)\n- [Segwit adoption increasing!

Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). \n\nA few thousand bitcoin users from \/r\/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges\/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let's make 80%+ SegWit happen fast. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. \n\n___________________\n\n**ACTION STEPS**\n\n1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. \n2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed\/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail\n3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.\n4. Spread the word! Conact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange. \n\n__________________________\n\n**SELECTED TOP EXCHANGES BY SEGWIT &amp; BATCHING STATUS**\n\n| Exchange            | Segwit Status | Batching Status |\n|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Binance             | *NOT READY*   | **Yes**               |\n| Bitfinex            | Ready         | ?               |\n| Bitonic             | Ready         | ~~?~~ **Yes**               |\n| Bitstamp  | **Deployed**  | **Yes**             |\n| Bittrex             | ?             | **Yes**             |\n| Coinbase\/GDAX       | *NOT READY*     | No             |\n| Gemini              | Ready         | No              |\n| HitBTC              |  **Deployed**       | **Yes**             |\n| Huboi               | ?             | ?               |\n| Kraken              | Ready         | **Yes**             |\n| LocalBitcoins       | Ready         | ?               |\n| OKEx                | ?             | ?               |\n| Poloniex            | ?             | **Yes**             |\n| QuadrigaCX          | **Deployed**  | **Yes**             |\n| Shapeshift          | **Deployed**  | No              |\n\n[Source 1](https:\/\/bitcoincore.org\/en\/segwit_adoption\/)\n\n[Source 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/7kherf\/what_exchanges_batch_there_withdrawal_txs_to_save\/)\n___________________\n\n**SELECTED WALLETS THAT HAVE SEGWIT ALREADY** \n\nMake sure you have a SegWit capable wallet installed and ready to use for your next bitcoin transaction\n\n| SegWit Enabled Wallets | Wallet Type |\n|------------------------|-------------|\n| Ledger Nano S          | Hardware    |\n| Trezor                 | Hardware    |\n| Electrum               | Desktop     |\n| Armory                 | Desktop     |\n| Edge                   | iOS         |\n| GreenAddress           | iOS         |\n| BitWallet              | iOS         |\n| Samourai               | Android     |\n| GreenBits              | Android     |\n| Electrum               | Android     |\n\n\n\n______________________\n\n**FAQs**\n\nIf I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?\n\n- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unneccessary transactions for now. \n\nCan you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? \n\n- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address.\n\n A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. \n\n A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.\n\n A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.\n\n [Source](https:\/\/howtotoken.com\/explained\/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-SegWit-transactions)\n\nWhat wallet are you using to \"batch your sends\"? And how can I do that?\n\n- Using Electrum, the \"Tools\" menu option: \"Pay to many\".\n\n Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.\n\nWhy doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?\n \n - The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in\n \nWhy isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready &amp; deployed when much smaller exchanges already are?

{"question":"If you print more money off record and distribute it to everyone somehow would that still increase inflation? If the recorded money supply doesn't change and government bonds stay intact, chances are it wouldn't have a big impact on the economy (?), at least not on inflation the only issue would be the process of printing money or maybe inserting cash into machines, deposits and all plus probably tax evasion but if the government is out of it, in short term it would be like everyone just finding a million bucks on the street.  \nI am aware it will have huge repercussions on supply and demand, if you get free money it's basically the death of production and productivity but I am only interested in knowing about inflation here. Thank you","answer":"These hypotheticals are easier to think about it if you imagine large sums.

Where would the actual resources even come from?\n\nIn practice, now wealthy people would bid up the cost of things (imagine an actual bidding war at a house auction).

He, ultimately, has the final say in their operations. *However*, he leaves them as separate entities and doesn't engage in monopolistic business practices. So no industry consolidation and no price-fixing. Would Iger, as a person, be considered a monopoly by the government? And would he be forced to sell his shares in some of the companies?","answer":"\"Is X a monopoly\" is a simple yes\/no question, if they are the only seller in the market, they are a monopoly.\n\nHowever that's usually not really the relevant question, we don't care that much if you're the only seller, we care if a company *acts* like a monopoly. I mean, there are plenty of talks about Amazon's market power, just saying \"it's not a problem because they are not a monopoly since there are &gt;0 other online shops\" is a bit silly.\n\nTo answer your question, if these companies Bob owns are not acting like monopolies, there's not much reason to step in, even though they might be a monopoly on paper.

The leadership is there and the Foundation has proven to me that it is capable of understanding the proper incentivization structure needed to succeed. It's a different culture altogether. Look how far Ethereum has come in such a short time. I see its vision materializing a little more each day. It's no longer possible to deny its insane adoption rate and the number of projects being built on it. In my personal opinion, all it will take is one well-timed dapp to come along and hit the nail on the head and the price will go into the stratosphere. And when it happens, many more will follow. \n\n\nI'm clearly biased, but there was a point when I was looking at Ethereum from the outside and I have to say, I've never regretted the choice I made after many hours of tireless research.

{"question":"Stocks and Bonds during inflation from Dr. Bernstein book Deep Risk Saw some good questions about equities and bonds during inflation and wanted to review Bernstein Deep Risk book to clarify some of the key points that were made in my summary.  From Pages 23-33 of Deep Risk by William Bernstein\n\nSevere and persistent inflation reduced equity returns, but it did not savage them.  Even in the areas hit hardest by inflation.  Equity holders came out even (0% real return) or decently ahead over long periods (3% real return).\n\nEven German investors broke even if they were able to hold on to equities during the hyperinflation.  Bond holders of course, were wiped out.  \n\nIn the US, the sweet spot for united states equities was between 0-4%.  Average P\/E was 17.5 during this time.  When inflation was over 6% though, P\/E was 10.\n\nStock and Bonds are negatively correlated to inflation in the short term.  In the short term(about 1 year), stocks do bad during inflation(-12%), but bonds do even worse(-23%).  \n\nKey Point of above - Over the long term, stocks, although suffering from inflation in the short term, protect against it in the long term.   To put it another way, stocks exacerbate shallow risk, but protect against deep risk.  Another reason to hold a globally diversified portfolio is that it is unlikely all nations would have inflation and bad luck all at the same time.  \n\nInvesting in bonds when inflation is currently low is a bad strategy.  Inflation devastates bonds, but only when it is unexpected.  When it surprises to the upside, it drives down bond prices and yields up dramatically. \n\nBonds of nations with the highest 1 year TRAILING inflation had the highest returns going forward, and that the bonds of the nations with the lowest TRAILING inflation had the lowest returns going forward.  This makes sense; bonds respond to surprises and when it is either very high or very low, it tends to surprise to the downside or upside.  \n\nHigh inflation also introduces uncertainty, tends to drive bond yields higher than trailing inflation.   This usually sets the stage for high subsequent bond returns.  This is what happened during the Volker years in the United States\n\nThe strategy for above is to stay away from bonds for a few years after inflation has begun to rear its ugly head before jumping back in.  Also, a globally diversified stock portfolio, hedges deep risk very well.  A fixed rate mortgage is also a wonderful idea.\n\nHere is the Deep Risk Post\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bogleheads\/comments\/sdr4nw\/young_investors_seriesthe_ages_of_the_investor\/","answer":"&gt;Another reason to hold a globally diversified portfolio is that it is   \nunlikely all nations would have inflation and bad luck all at the same   \ntime.\n\nAbout as unlikely as, say... a deadly global pandemic + invasion of a top food exporter + sanctions against a top oil producer? \n\nWhat a time to be alive."}
{"question":"What\u2019s the catch with investing in Miami condos? Miami rents have skyrocketed over the past year in Brickell and Midtown where a lot of young professionals have moved to due to remote work. Average 1 bed rents in these areas are $3k or higher, which is comparable to SF or LA and maybe lower end Manhattan\/Brooklyn. I\u2019m still seeing a lot of 1\/2 condos can be bought for $400k-$600k range in these areas. Depending on the building monthly rentals are allowed as well. \n\nHas anyone bought a rental property in Miami recently? Big HOA is probably the biggest downsides to these from what I can tell so far, and the quality of specific condo management seems to vary a lot.","answer":"Brickell and Midtown HOAs can easily be $700+\/mo and they are constantly increasing.

{"question":"I've reached my first savings goal! I only got my first full time job last year, after living my entire life off 0-hour contracts, UC, furlough and student loans, and any time I've tried to put money aside, I'd take it back out a week later. However, at the start of this year, I vowed that I'd put away at least \u00a3500 a month into my cash ISA, and get \u00a36000 in my account by the end of the year. And I did it! As of now, I have \u00a36100 in my savings, and that's after dipping into it several times throughout the year for a trip abroad, birthdays, Christmas, emergency costs, etc. While this money isnt anything in the grand scheme of things, I'm really proud of myself for actually saving it, and it's such a relief to know that the money in my bank isn't the only money I have, and that my savings exist as a safety cushion. My long term intention is for my savings to go towards a deposit for a flat\/house, and I know that I'd need to basically be a millionaire for that to be a reality, I'm a step closer.\n\nSorry if this comes off as bragging but I'm just happy to be financially stable for the first time in my life without feeling like I'm always on the razor's edge, or feeling guilty that I'm leeching off my parents. It's just nice to have that little bit of control in my life.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the nice comments, I wasn't really expecting this many people to respond! I'm a massive noob when it comes to finances so I have next to no idea about the different account types; my cash ISA was originally made just for the sole purpose of being able to compartmentalise my money so I appreciate the advice some of you have given!","answer":"Well done!\n\nSome things to consider next:\n\n- If you're aiming for a house, putting some money in a LISA means you get a 25% bonus on it from it government. The downside is you can *only* use the money as a first-time buyer, or when you're over 60 - withdrawing for anything else has a penalty, so you need to have a separate emergency fund. \n\n- Take a look at moneysavingexpert.com to see what the best avaliable interest rates are for what you currently have, and find out more about all the different account types available. You don't really need you savings to be in an ISA unless you're getting at least \u00a31000\/year interest (for basic rate tax payers; less for higher earners)."}

{"question":"The case against one-more-year syndrome *Note: sorry for the somewhat depressing topic below\n\n\nAlmost anyone looking at RE has a concern about running out of money.  One thing I haven't seen a huge discussion on is the risk of retiring too late - perhaps the regret of missing out on time with friends\/family.  It's easy to assume in our 20's, 30's, 40's that good health will continue, but the fact is our time on this planet is limited.  While nobody with a non-terminal illness can predict their own death, we can look at some statistics on the matter to embrace our inner-nerds and figure out the risk of not retiring ASAP.\n\n\nLet's look at a potential FIRE candidate.  FI male at age 40, married to female age 40, with two kids aged 7 and 10.  Let's say they have $40K\/year expenses with a paid off house and $1M in investments.  Now nobody knows the exact risk of running out of money in retirement, but for the sake of argument let's assume they have flexibility in their expenses to cut back and they estimate a 93% probability of not running out of their money.\n\n\nThese FIers are considering working 1 more year to turn this 93% into a 95% probability of success.\n\n\nOK, so for the flip side of things: working 1 more year might turn out to be a mistake because someone's health takes a dive and everyone regrets not stopping work earlier for more quality time.  Now everyone's feelings of 'regret' are going to vary here.  For myself, I would like to have at least 10 years of retired life without anyone in my immediate family perishing or becoming disabled, so let's use that as an example.\n\nSo what are the odds that FI male and female make it to age 51 with everyone still in good health?  For this we can look at the [SSA actuarial tables](https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/oact\/STATS\/table4c6.html).  \n\nA 40-year old male has a 0.2092% chance of dying at age 40.\n\nAt age 41 this increases to 0.2240%\n\nIf we combine all the probabilities from 40 through 50, his odds of surviving to age 51 are: 96.418%   (kind of a bummer isn't it?)\n\nNow, for me I also want my spouse and children to survive that decade, so let's throw them in the mix as well.\n\n* Odds of female surviving age 40 through 50: 97.720%\n* Odds of male child surviving age 7 through 17: 99.736%\n* Odds of female child surviving age 10 through 20: 99.772%\n\nThe combined probability of all 4 surviving for the whole 11 years is: **93.757%**\n\nYikes.\n\nNow, you might be saying: I have above average health and I've made it this far, so my odds are probably better than average.  That might be true, but at this point we've only looked at deaths.  If you also throw disabilities into the mix, the average will likely get pulled back down.  The SSA has [data on disabilities](https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/oact\/NOTES\/ran6\/) too, but it's a bit more complicated and I haven't put in the effort to calculate it.  Suffice to say that more people become disabled each year than die in the 40-50 age group.  (To be fair, not all SSA disabilities are permanent, however). \n\nSo if our example FIers accept the sad fact that there's &gt;6% chance of losing a family member in the next decade, the 93% success rate over a long retirement doesn't seem quite so bad.  \n\n**TLDR**  Life is short; health is fleeting. Don't put off spending time with those you love for a small % increase in probability of success in retirement.\n\n","answer":"I'm an actuary, so I'm quite familiar with the numbers that you are trying to present here.Technically, your math is correct, but if I turned this risk assessment into my boss, I'd probably get fired on the spot. You're comparing one year of working for one person with the risk of dying for a combined 4 people over an 11 year period? Just...I don't have words. \n\nDear God, this doesn't even get into how incorrect the approach is on both long-term risk, the fact that no, assuming that you'll be in good health in the future because you're in good health at 40? Most people are! The real risk comes in your 50's."}

{"question":"Trying to understand the ARK Fund Backlash Cathie Wood has been getting slammed lately as the ARK Funds suffer some steep losses. My question is what is she supposed to do? Growth stocks as a whole have been taking a hit. The ARK Funds are described on their website as \u201cETFs focused on disruptive innovation\u201d. This alone says ARK is bit of a risk and will focus on companies replacing the status quo. That may take some time. I do believe it will happen though. Take ARKF, for instance, she\u2019s not going to go and invest in a company that prints out paper checks or manufactures atm cards. Square, Shopify, Zillow are a few of the top holdings. Obviously, each has seen incredible growth. They may taking a hit now but may represent the status quo in the future.\n\nAlso, other fintech etfs have suffered the same fate recently. Others may not have fallen so far but that seems to be because they weren\u2019t as successful during the big run up late last year\n\nI'm a novice investor and I\u2019m genuinely curious as to what she could have done differently. Is it how certain companies were weighted in the funds? Or did she just choose the wrong companies?","answer":"So I mean, I don't know what everyone expected, but it isn't normal for any stock, ETF, or even industry sector to just go straight up forever without periods of major sell off and consolidation. And considering the fuckery that's going on with the FED, money is a little scared right now.\n\nI'm certainly not going to be selling my ARK funds. The reasons I bought them for haven't changed. Just like I have no plans to sell off my individual stocks in the EV and other growth sectors. In fact, if the downtrend continues, I'll probably add to some positions here in a quick minute (it's just not quite there yet). And I mean sure, certain portions of my Roth look like a dumpster fire right now, but I got 30 years. A little market pull back don't scare me."}

It\u2019s a huge place with 20k employees, so not every person who went to work somewhere else necessarily means malicious behavior. \n\nNot saying that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing here.

{"question":"Why was privatization in the 80's so rampant? U.K., U.S., Canada, Germany and a lot of other western countries all elected governments that seemed to have a fetish for privatizing and overall general laissez-fare economics; why did this liberalization of the market all seem to happen simultaneously around the western world in the 1980's?","answer":"It was mainly a combination of experiences with and subsequent disappointments in, the nationalisations of earlier decades and the need to address government fiscal crisises in less painful ways than cutting social benefits or raising taxes. There were also some more theoretical arguments for reform based on making governance more transparent to voters and thus hopefully more effective and efficient. Nationalised industries had a reputation for inefficiency and poor quality. When I was young and my mother wished to buy ferry tickets to cross the Cook Strait she would gather up her children and any of our friends she could borrow and descend upon the Railways ticket office where she'd let us run riot, as an incentive for the office staff to produce our tickets fast.\n\nOne thing to note was that loosely-similar reforms were carried out by a range of countries and political parties, including Sweden and Denmark, and, in Australia, the Labor Party under the Hawke-Keating government and in New Zealand the Labour Party under the Lange-Douglas government. There was a widespread recognition of the arguments for reform across the political spectrum. \n\nThe NZ Treasury's [1984 briefing to the incoming government](https:\/\/www.treasury.govt.nz\/publications\/bim\/economic-management-briefing-incoming-government-1984-html) is I think a classic of the time."}

If you don\u2019t have an existing brokerage Fidelity is a great option. They even have a credit card that you can use to earn rewards that get redeemed directly into an account monthly, including a 529. I\u2019m not sure if there is a way to split the rewards between two but it\u2019s a great way to put some extra dollars in an account."}
{"question":"Wanted to share a quick story of my recent trip to Paris... Just got back from Paris and wanted to share this with everyone as I thought it was pretty cool. \n\nWhile vacationing in Paris, I stumbled upon a bar in the back streets of Paris one night and I saw that they accepted \u202aBitcoin on the window. When I got inside, I ordered a beer and some other drinks and I was messaging my friend on facebook back home in Miami at the same time telling him that I was about to pay in bitcoin for some drinks I just ordered. Shortly thereafter, he responded and told me to send him the public address for the tab and he would pay for it instead. After my friend sent the btc, the bartender held up his iPad and showed everyone else sitting at the bar the confirmation on his \u202a#\u200eblockchain\u202c wallet and explained in French what had just happened; everyone freaked out and tried to wrap their heads around it. They were stunned that someone in Miami just paid for my drinks instantly while I was in Paris. The bartender\/owner gave me a hug and a free shot and I was smothered in drunken high fives by the others in the bar...all of this because of a paid tab...oh and \u202a\u200eHistory\u202c was just made. \u202a\n\nTL;DR: Friend paid for my drinks at a bar from another country.\n\nPic link: http:\/\/imgur.com\/5yZC4iD\n\nSof's Bar in Paris: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Sofs-Bar\/186530834694794","answer":"Actually this is a very nice safety feature for the future! Since you are not carrying any money and not even the option to pay, only thing you can do is take a QR code and ask someone else pay, there is no way to get robbed on-site. Except for getting taken and being asked for ransom that is ;)\n\nIf you don't want someone else, you can also have your external payment provider have a spending limit which can change anytime easily, but only from certain locations (@home or @work for instance). Or an automatic limit when your not at home. Endless possibilities!\n"}
{"question":"Is buying a house in the next 6 months a terrible idea? So my husband and I were planning on buying a house this year. Preferably before October. We have the down payment as of now, but haven't shopped around for our banker\/interest rates yet. (Were planning to middle of March, but we all know what happened with that..)\n\nThings are going downhill fast in terms of the economy, obviously. Our initial thought was that, after this covid-19 business has died down, interest rates will be low and it will be a buyer's market. But then we worry about selling in 4-6 years. \n\nWhat are the possible pros and cons to buying this year? Should we just wait another year? Or will things not be any better in a year and it won't matter? \n\nI understand this is all speculation and we won't know what's going to happen, but any advice\/thoughts on this are appreciated!\n\nEdit- since it's come up a lot, my income is secure. I have a job that's not going anywhere. We're buying on just my income, too. So husband's income will be towards living expenses\/savings.","answer":"I am in the same boat except I am under contract and just locked in a rate. We are going to go ahead because it is a potential forever home for us in a great area. I tell you though, I constantly think about how prices will probably drop and our house will take many years to appreciate at all. But, it will be a great house for my family. If you haven't found the hosue of your dreams, wait.\n\nSide note: interest rates are volatile, but we got a 3% rate yesterday. So, if you go now you could get a solid rate.\n\nEdit: This post seems to have gotten a little bit of interest especially on the rate.  u\/ApolloKid made an astute recommendation that I share a little more info. Concerning the mortgage, it is a 30 year fixed rate **VA** (that's important) loan. The rate was 3% with a loan origination fee of $450ish dollars with a 800+ credit score. The bank is Synovus. It has come to my attention that VA home loans typically have better rates than conventional which I didn't realize and have probably mislead some people. If so, sorry about that. I wish y'all all the best in your immediate or future house hunting!\n\nTLDR: I'm buying a forever home disregarding coronavirus effects. I got a great rate on a VA loan."}
{"question":"How to protect against the potential recession and stagflation? My (M38, Eastern Europe) current net worth is currently split up as:\n\n* 30% is the value of my apartment\n* 20% in stocks - been selling since February, only VWCE remaining now\n* 25% in cash - I have just taken a mortgage, and around half of this is reserved to cover the upcoming downpayment \n* 25% in crypto, including stablecoins\n\nIt seems that all classes of assets are  going down now while inflation is going up, and some speculate that a recession is inevitable. I am worried that my monthly mortgage payments will go up a lot as the interest rates rises, and that at the same time my investments will keep going losing their value due to a recession.\n\nI have a couple of ideas what to do next to hedge against this:\n\n\\- invest in commodities like gold\n\n\\- keep a lot of cash for the next year or so, see if there is a recession, then get back in stocks, potentially at a \"discount\" prices\n\n\\- keep a lot of cash even longer so that I have the option to pay back the mortgage faster if I want to\n\nWhat do you think about these ideas?","answer":"I wouldn\u2019t keep cash around in a high inflation scenario. I\u2019d rather keep investing. \n\nAbout gold, I\u2019d suggest watching Ben Felix\u2019s video on the topic. Historically, it hasn\u2019t proved to be a shelter against recession when compared to other things (long term scenarios). \n\nCrypto is out of discussion if you want to protect your money, is a high risk asset with no real fundamental behind. Do invest in it if you think is worth it, but recent history shows that is not isolated from the rest of the investment ecosystems."}
{"question":"My job has called me back to work, but I\u2019m making more money on unemployment. Throw away account\n\nI was furloughed from my job in the healthcare industry 6 weeks ago because of COVID-19 and I have been receiving unemployment from both the state and federal government. I am currently receiving more money from unemployment, even after taxes, than I was making at my current job working 40 hours. They are only offering me 30 hours right now, but working 30 hours would put me over the limit for being eligible for unemployment. The extra money the past few weeks has helped my husband and I out tremendously to pay on past due debt and to put a little away into savings. I\u2019m having a difficult time right now trying to figure out what to do about my job. Unemployment won\u2019t last forever, I know, but the opportunity to have a higher income even temporarily has been our saving grace. How do I move forward without putting my husband and I back into a tight spot with our finances?","answer":"It sucks but just go back.  My wife works for the Dept of Labor in the state we live in and they conduct audits\/investigations for all claims.  When they find out, and they will, you were asked to go back to work and declined it to keep getting unemployment benefits you will have to pay back those benefits and then some."}
{"question":"What was your biggest gain on a single stock and how did you actually find (out about) it in the first place? So, as I'm relatively new to stocks nothing shocking but one day I decided to FOMO into $NIO for around $2k which resulted in a profit of $2k one week after. \nFound out about NIO on this sub as it was hard to miss, especially back then.","answer":"AMD, back in 2016. I had them on my watch list since they were in the $3 range and remember being pissed when they jumped up to $6 just 3 months later. So I bought in for a few hundred shares. \n\nI also work in tech, and keep up on this stuff regularly. I came across info on their new Zen platform coming out. I figured with intel being stagnant, AMD had a chance to get back some market share. \n\nWhen it hit $12 the next year, I started seeing a lot more AMD talk. And then it traded up and down in the $12-$15 range for a while. (I remember all the memes of AMD being free money, buy at $12, sell at $15, rinse and repeat).\n\nNow, I certainly can't say I expected them to hit $90, but it's crazy to see how far it's come in 5 years since I bought in.\n\nI'm still holding"}
{"question":"[Mod-post] What do you want from this subreddit? Hey everyone\n\nThe mod-team have been talking about the direction of this sub, prompted by the recent thread asking for a weekly \u201crate my portfolio\u201d thread (which already exists!).\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that UKInvesting has played second fiddle to \/r\/ukpersonalfinance since we started running both subreddits, because at the time it was a fairly small, high-quality community, and last time I asked what you wanted from the mods, the answer was basically \u201cnothing\u201d.\n\nSince then Reddit has introduced interest-based and geographical subreddit discovery, and the quality has dropped as the community has grown.\n\nWe want to hear from regular users - what do you want?

{"question":"Extremely high profit margins in some industries I live in Sofia, Bulgaria. Lately, I realise that some industries run insanely high profit margins. For example, people in construction tell me that the average cost for a decent quality building is 300\u20ac\/sq. m. The average sale price per sq. m. is around 1000\u20ac currently. Although, there might be other costs involved, a construction developer can easily make over 100% profit. Workers have literally no bargaining power and cannot bargain for a higher cut from the profit margin. The high demand for housing is simply increasing the margins constantly while the developers do not even have the incentive to build high quality buildings. The sector is heavily regulated although comparing with other countries it seems deregulated in many aspects.  Do you think there is a market mechanism that will reduce margins naturally or will this just keep going until the next housing bust? Thanks!","answer":"So at least from this data:\n\nhttps:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/docsroom\/documents\/30341\/attachments\/1\/translations\/en\/renditions\/pdf\n\nthe gross operating surplus is below EU average and falling, which is an indicator for profit.\n\nDon't necessarily trust what laypeople tell you. They often don't have good data, don't use that data correctly and are bad at defining what they are talking about. Maybe the cost for materials is 300\u20ac per m\u00b2, but there are many more costs on top of that.\n\nAnyway, to get back to your question.\n\n&gt;Do you think there is a market mechanism that will reduce margins naturally or will this just keep going until the next housing bust? Thanks!\n\nYes, there is a market mechanism! As profit goes up, there's a higher incentive to hire more people, invest more capital, and given enough time, start more companies, etc. So if profit goes up, investment into that sector, broadly speaking, also goes up, with new firm's popping up and existing firms expanding. Basically, higher profit leads to higher supply, and higher supply leads to lower prices.\n\nAll of this takes time of course, so you might get periods of high profit margins. And in reality, especially for something like construction, these markets are often highly regulated, inhibiting competition.\n\nBut fundamentally speaking it's as simple as profit incentivising higher supply and higher supply reducing profits.\n\nThis is a bit basic, if you have more questions feel free to ask!"}

There is a way to do it without potentially selling shares and that is what I'm advocating for me personally.","answer":"If they are the same I choose book entry because SHFs have screwed with us for too long\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn important thing to note is that SHFs have 1:x leverage to circulate counterfeit shares in the market. They do this to keep the price low, without which we'll see a repeat of Jan but much higher spike ultimately resulting in liquidation of SHFs.\n\nIf SHFs had unlimited leverage, they would have printed gazillion shares and make GME a penny stock, and forced everyone to paperhand by now. There would be no battle for 180, 190, or 200. The fact that they have not been able to pull the price back to even 140 is proof that they don't have unlimited leverage. Direct registration of shares at Computer share reduces SHF leverage.\n\nThe logic is pretty simple. Say for example SHFs have 1:10 leverage, for every one share that's moved via DRS to Computershare, they have to close the 10 fake shares, or increase the collateral 10 times (outstanding counterfeit share) to kick the FTD can. The more real shares that are taken away from DTC, the SHF collateral requirement goes up in multiple of leverage.\n\nThis is how big boys burned because of reckless leverage during 2008. It's similar story here. Fun fact: Steve Eiseman quoted \"They took leverage for genius\" in the context of 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe ONLY thing you can do in addition to hold and buy, is really HOLD it at a safe place like Computershare. Benefits in addition to holding real share in your name vs street name include:\n\n* They will not lend your shares to be shorted against you\n* They don't hold IOU\/counterfeit shares, so every share you hold is real\n* ETFs can't borrow\/buy from them, so these shares cannot be used for short attack\n* They don't turn off the buy or sell button when you need it the most\n* DTC cannot do funny accounting like 'continious net settlement' to help SHFs kick the FTD can forever\n* In summary it's a SAFE place to HOLD. And it severely reduces SHFs leverage to conduct fraud\n\nMoass will be very different to gamma squeeze in Jan. The initial price surge may be because of gamma squeeze\/hedging, but the real rocket launch is when SHFs are liquidated because the price\/risk exceeds collateral they're able to post. Once liquidation starts, the liquidators will buy share at ANY ask price.\n\nIf 1x float is registered at Computershare, Moass will last as long as it takes to buy the float multiple times. For comparison, when GME last made 3.5M public offering, it took them over a week to sell without letting the price drop precipitously. Imagine how long it'll take to buy 200M shares without share price going to billions.\n\nOnce the initial gamma\/hedging price surge starts, you'll have couple of days or week for launch, which gives you adequate time to transfer from Computershare to a trusted broker if you want for easy selling. Or, another strategy will be to hold half at broker and half at Computershare and mitigate any uncertainty one may have.\n\nLong term investors can keep believing that the \"system\" will take care of them, or they can take action to make their own destiny.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a financial\/investment advisor. This is not advice or recommendation to buy or sell stocks."}

{"question":"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post So I made this [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/oe9ruu\/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash\/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.\n\nIn 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it\/stop using so much power\/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.\n\nSo, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.\n\nAll data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.\n\nIn 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:\n\nA 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?\n\nAre people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.\n\nIs it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.\n\nIs it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.\n\nIs it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.\n\nSo basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.\n\nSo, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:\n\n**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**\n\nYeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.\n\n**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**\n\nPositions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.\n\nOne last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.\n\nMy date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.\n\nEDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.\n\nI just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are \"housing is up where I live so there's no bubble\"  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.\n\nTo explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.\n\nEDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of \"but people own more than one house\" posts.

I\u2019ve always wanted to buy the range that I worked at as I know it has a lot of potential and I know how to run it but I have no idea where to even start when buying a business. It\u2019s not officially for sale so I\u2019d have to approach the owner myself. Here\u2019s a few questions I have to start with:\n\nHow much of a deposit is usually required and what is the max business loan I could get?

We usually refer to this \"household production\". The common IRL example people give is the young mother who stops working and stays home to care for the child.

{"question":"Wall Street On Parade Dec 6, 2022: \"Secretary Yellen, We\u2019ve Got a 'Staggering' Problem: New Report Shows Foreign Banks Have Secret Derivative Debt that Is '10 Times their Capital'\" \u2014 Archive Article Link: https:\/\/archive.ph\/OXwAk #[\"Secretary Yellen, We\u2019ve Got a 'Staggering' Problem: New Report Shows Foreign Banks Have Secret Derivative Debt that Is '10 Times their Capital'\"](https:\/\/archive.ph\/OXwAk)\n\nBy [Pam Martens and Russ Martens](https:\/\/archive.ph\/ODR8L): December 6, 2022 ~\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has the dual role of Chairing the [Financial Stability Oversight Council (F-SOC)](https:\/\/archive.ph\/Ww7gr), whose role is to provide \u201ccomprehensive monitoring of the stability of our nation\u2019s financial system.\u201d Heads of each of the federal agencies that supervise Wall Street and the mega banks sit in on meetings of F-SOC.\n\nOne would think that such an august body would have a handle on \u201cstaggering\u201d threats to the U.S. financial system \u2013 especially since F-SOC was created under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation to prevent a replay of the off-balance sheet derivatives that crashed the U.S. economy in 2008 and forced an unprecedented and secret bailout of U.S. and foreign global banks by the Federal Reserve [to the tune of $29 trillion](https:\/\/archive.ph\/ga8Ai). If Yellen is aware of the latest threat to financial stability, she\u2019s not sharing the details with the public. That information came yesterday by way of [a stunning report](https:\/\/archive.ph\/Q048C) authored by Claudio Borio, Robert McCauley and Patrick McGuire for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\n\nThe report focuses on the amount of derivative debt that is not being captured through regular statistical reporting because it is held off the balance sheet. These derivatives consist of foreign exchange swaps, forwards and currency swaps. The authors call this exposure \u201cstaggering\u201d but focus primarily on the potential for upsets to dollar swap lines to settle it as it comes due. A greater concern, in our estimation, is this line from the report: \u201cFor banks headquartered outside the United States, dollar debt from these instruments is estimated at $39 trillion, more than double their on-balance sheet dollar debt and more than 10 times their capital.\u201d Their on-balance sheet dollar debt is $15 trillion.\n\nThis is [reminiscent of Goldman Sachs engaging in derivative trades with Greece](https:\/\/archive.ph\/VbJbo) to hide its mountain of debt prior to it blowing up.\n\nGlobal foreign banks are \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 an integral part of the U.S. financial system. When there is a crisis, such as the Wall Street implosion in 2008 or the pandemic in 2020, the Federal Reserve bails out global foreign banks along with global domestic banks. Why does it do that? Because the trading units of foreign global banks, as well as domestic global banks, make up what the Fed calls its \u201c[primary dealers](https:\/\/archive.ph\/PFG3z).\u201d The primary dealers are contractually obligated to make purchases of U.S. Treasury securities at each U.S. Treasury auction and to trade with the New York Fed to carry out Federal Reserve monetary policy.\n\nSince the financial crisis of 2008 and the eventual disclosure of the Fed\u2019s unprecedented bailouts, the Fed has made a big show of conducting stress tests and bragging about the high level of capital it requires of the G-SIBS ([Global Systemically Important Banks](https:\/\/archive.ph\/9sAZe)). So to learn from the Bank for International Settlements yesterday that foreign banks have $39 trillion in derivative debts that are not showing on their balance sheets and that represent \u201c10 times their capital\u201d makes the Fed, F-SOC and its Chair, Janet Yellen, look very Alan Greenspan-esque. Greenspan, Chairman of the Fed for an unprecedented 19 years from 1987 to 2006, was asleep at the switch as Wall Street built up its off-balance sheet toxic derivatives that would blow up the U.S. economy in 2008. Greenspan had argued against the regulation of derivatives.\n\nAn equal concern for Yellen, Congress, and every engaged American is the fact that all it takes is one heavily interconnected global bank (foreign or domestic) to set off a wave of contagion in global financial markets. And, there is no question that the counterparties to a significant amount of that $39 trillion in off-balance sheet derivative debt at foreign banks are the big five derivative banks in the U.S.: JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley.\n\nHow do we know that? Because the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency publishes a \u201c[Quarterly Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives Activities](https:\/\/archive.ph\/BMBm6).\u201d In the most recent report for the second quarter of this year, those five bank holding companies listed above represented $221.539 trillion in notional derivative exposures, or 84 percent of the derivative exposures of the largest 25 bank holding companies in the U.S. (See Table 14 in the Appendix of the OCC report linked above.)\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s not like the share price of these global foreign banks aren\u2019t screaming that there\u2019s a big problem. Credit Suisse (Ticker CS) closed yesterday at $3.34, 35 cents from its all-time low and down 65 percent year-to-date. Mizuho Financial Group (Ticker MFG) is also trading in the low single digits, closing yesterday in New York at $2.38. Mizuho\u2019s share price has failed to recover materially since the financial crisis of 2008. The large German lender, Deutsche Bank, also has significant headwinds. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares closed at $10.60 yesterday in New York, less than one-fifth of its share price during the financial crisis in 2008.","answer":"it really is something to have seen this shit coming for a year or more and to watch it play out in slow motion. everyone i know, knows to some extent that something is coming... according to me... and it's neat to hear them say didn't you say this was coming??"}
{"question":"Berkshire Hathaway is an Indicator of GME Spikes. Is Warren Buffet the Final Boss? Oh man do I have something juicy and tit-jacking for you! This is so insane I can barely believe it but it\u2019s hard to deny. \n\n##MAIN THESIS##\n\nThis is a daily chart of GME plotted against BRK.A.  \n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ntCwQ26.jpg\n\nI submit that **BRK.A is a leading indicator for GME price movement.** Similar movement usually follows a week or two later (it seems to be around 6-10 days to me but maybe sometimes longer, i have quants working on the data, this is a brand new finding of mine). BRK peaks, GME peaks later. \n\nSince at least May 2021, BRK.A price spikes have led GME price spikes, but for every single GME spike after the June one, we have peaked 6-10 trading days after the preceding BRK.A peak. \n\nLook at BRK in May: spikes up, then GME follows.  August: BRK spikes up, GME follows. October: BRK spikes up, GME follows. December: BRK spikes up...GME....\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80? \n\nIt works on dips too. BRK.A dips just a bit before GME dips. If you look, even the smaller fluctuations in price movement track pretty well. Even the FLOORS track, with BRK.A retracing its floor after each of its peaks, and GME retracing its floor after each of its peaks. \n\n##EXAMPLE##\n\nHere's an example if anyone wants to follow me on the chart. I used TradingView set to 1 day candles. \n\n-\tBRK.A was trading sideways in late July, then had a run up and hit a high on 8\/11. Our price movement followed in lockstep around 9 trading days later with a giant green candle on 8\/24. Then, on 8\/12-13 BRK.A dipped a bit, but bounced right back up and almost retraced the high, a movement echoed by GME on 9\/2 (though we beat our 8\/24 high slightly). \n\n-\tThen, starting BRK.A dips down, hitting a low on 8\/23, then rebounding to a lower peak than previously. Our corresponding move can be seen at GME\u2019s opening low on 9\/9, rebounding to a lower peak on 9\/16. \n\n-\tThen, starting on 9\/2, BRK.A dips a lot, hitting a low on 9\/22, bouncing up on 9\/27, then dropping back down to the previous low on 9\/30. GME\u2019s corresponding movement can be seen starting 9\/17, hitting our low on 10\/6, rebounding on 10\/11, the dipping again. \n\n-\tThen, BRK has a run up peaking on 10\/26. Followed by GME\u2019s November run up, peaking on 11\/3. The second November spike gets a bit murky because they seem to move together, but then look at what happens next. \n\n-\tThen BRK.A starts its dip on 11\/23, hitting its floor on 12\/1, then on 12\/1 it basically exploded upward like crazy and is still going. It hit a peak on 12\/16 and retraced a bit, then went back up and is still going today. We follow with our dip, back to our floor. And then, if this pattern holds\u2026\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nThere have also been **significant anomalies with BRK.A** this year: a huge increase in volume, no FTD\u2019s since March 2020, and weird after-hours price glitches\/spikes. \n\n##WHYYYYYYY##\n\nThis is my own personal tinfoil, but ever since Bill Gates went on CNBC back in Feb or whatever to talk shit about GME ([video link thanks to u\/dcarmona](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PVBdyYynDNE)), I\u2019ve been suspicious that he and\/or his best buddy Warren Buffet might be involved somehow in the GME saga. Like, CNBC didn\u2019t just call up Bill Gates and get him on the show. It\u2019s Bill fucking Gates. He asked them to come on. and he looked pretty worked up for Bill. I\u2019ve seen a good number of Bill Gates interviews, and would say I\u2019ve never seen him like that. Check out his body language, the crossed arms, the sideways looks before he talks, he just looks uncomfortable. It made me sus. \n\nI do not have a clear mechanism for WHY BRK would be acting as a leading indicator. One theory is that shorts are using BRK to pad their books. Pump the BRK price, then sell and cover GME run ups\/fails\/swaps\/etc, then short back down, pad the books with GME repeat?  \n\nAnother possibility is that Buffet is helping out some Wall Street pals. Some Buffet documentary I saw months ago said that in 2008, Lehman Bros tried to get Buffet to bail them out, because he was known on Wall St as a guy you could go to if you needed cash. maybe Kenny needed a \u201cpayday loan\u201d? I dunno. \n\nMore work on this may be forthcoming. But I literally realized this tonight after looking at this comparson numerous times. Some quant oriented folks are going to run some numbers too, so I may have more to report in the future.\n\n## TO APE CAN\u2019T READ ##\n\nBRK.A seems to be a leading indicator of GME price movement.  BRK.A goes up, GME goes up a little while later.

{"question":"Craigslist Subletting Scam Alert Hello r\/personalfinance,\n\nI would like to share with you a scam that my roommate almost got himself into, until I talked him out of it and read the email exchange. My roommate is planning on subletting his apartment for the summer, and posted an ad on Craigslist. He got a response the same day from a \"girl\" from Switzerland. The girl asked him to immediately remove the listing so that he was committed to the deal. She told him she was willing to pay any price, and move in\/out on any day. The only caveat, however, was that she would have her boss send him a check for more than the amount for rent and utilities for the entire summer, and then he would send back the remainder. On top of this, she needed the remaining money so she could book her flight over here. This meant he would need to send the money back soon, before he could really check to see if the check clears. She also told him to take as much as he needed, with no real set price, and this was before seeing any pictures of the apartment.\n\nHe thought this sounded totally reasonable, and was about to do it, before I warned him not to and to look into it some more. I knew from reading on this subreddit, that many scams involve sending a check to a person, then having the person send money back before the check completely clears, so thank you r\/personalfinance! I am almost positive this is a scam, and wanted to thank you guys, and watch out for this kind of scam for yourselves!\n","answer":"Hey stranger I've never met, I'd like to rent the apartment I've never seen in a city I've never been to.

{"question":"Did you miss the current home price boom because of bad advice from Reddit posters? Wise up. It was just announced that home appreciation in the US for the year ended February 2022 was **19.8%**. I wonder if any of those who decided to **sit out** the \u201ccrazy\u201d market, or those geniuses here who were recommending that course of action here a year or more ago, are willing and mature enough to now **admit they were wrong**. I won\u2019t hold my breath.\n\nStock market pushers are fond of saying index funds have averaged 12% annual return since the Depression or something like that. I do not believe those claimed returns, but that sort of discussion is for another Reddit Group. \n\nBut I do want to note that you sometimes also read that the **average annual return does not mean every year**. Those articles rightly point out that the **average day or year is a much lower rate of return**. The higher overall average stems from a **handful of lurches upward**. Those articles usually say something like, \u201cIf you were in the S&amp;P 500 on these 61 days and no others, you would have gotten 90% of the increase in your stocks that those who were in the S&amp;P 500 for 75 years got.\n\nIn other words, being in the stock market or owning a home is not profitable because of the run-of-the-mill year. You profit from being in the market for decades because that means you were there **when the relatively few boom times occurred**. Now look at the covid era. I think it may have been the biggest U.S. home price boom ever. The early 2000s were also a big boom but then it collapsed for reasons that are not present now\u2014the SubPrime crisis.\n\nThose of us who generally make it a point to own a home got the benefit of the recent boom. Those who **sat out** the market **missed** its best ever lurch upward. \n\nI have been buying residential real estate since 1969. Every year I bought, as here at this Reddit group, many people told me, \u201c**now is not the time to invest**.\u201d Not only did they tell me \u201cnot now\u201d every year for various reasons, but there was **never** a year since 1969 when people said, \u201cThis **is** the time to buy a home.\u201d\n\nAnd you know what\u2019s going to happen now? People are going to say it\u2019s too late. You needed to buy a home in 2021 or 2020. Now the boom is over. Maybe the same geniuses who told you not to buy in 2020 or 2021.\n\nLast May, when many here were screaming like banshees that you had to be crazy to buy then, my wife, youngest son, and I looked at three houses, made offers on two, and bought one. Asking $750,000. We offered $900,000. We got it. The son lives there now. Redfin says it is now worth $1.1M, 11 months later.\n\nWhat we did strikes me as a normal, relatively easy home purchase. I am not surprised by the appreciation since then. I would not have guessed 20%, but I would have guessed 10%. But I have been doing this for 53 years. Had I asked people here when we were considering making an offer on that house, I would have gotten a ton of rants about the market being insane and offering $150,000 over asking was unquestionably nuts, yadda yadda. It may be that this Reddit group is **mainly** the **blind leading the blind**\u2014off a cliff.\n\nI think the way to use this group is to look at the **facts** and **logic** of the various posts. Ignore the rants and adjectives, adverbs, and the trash talk. There are people here who know what they are talking about. Many, maybe most, have **no clue** and maybe **no experience**, like a person who said only a crazy person would buy a home in 2021 and he himself was a 20-year old who has never owned a home.\n\nIf you are a beginner, you need good advice. That typically comes from experienced home owners or investors or people who work full-time in real estate. Getting financial advice on the biggest investment of your life from an **unknown** person hiding behind a fake name is probably not a good idea.","answer":"A rant from a realtor friend of mine... \"A client wanted to purchase a home for $375k, but the appraisal came back at $360.

The fact that she paid on the first even after she lost her job puts me at ease, but I'm still worried she won't find a job before the rent assistance runs out. \n\nIs anyone else dealing with this aswell?","answer":"Even at my most broke and my lowest of times, I found a way to pay my rent.

{"question":"How much would the average worker make if all money was distributed equally? GDP per capita in the US is approximately 62,000 dollars but GDP per worker is approximately 130,000 dollars. Hypothetically if every employed person earned an equal salary would everyone be making 130,000 dollars per year?","answer":"I believe there is other factors you haven't taken into account. Firstly you would be better of using national income as a figure of money earned as GDP details all goods and services produced in a countries borders. This means that that firms who have used foreign direct investment to produce in that country count towards GDP, however the return on capital of that given firm will flow back into the country of origin. A better way of measurement would be GDP+ net foreign asset position.\n\nAlso your question assumes that all of national income goes to labor. In reality roughly 30% of national income goes to capital in the form of rent,interest,dividends,profits,royalties, etc. Many people earn income from the production process but are not employed.\n\nThe last thing being a market economy with fluctuating prices could not function if the wage rates were artificially high. This would mean production costs would not reflect to perceived value of the good or service and of the marginal productivity of the laborer. If you don't want to distort the price mechanism in both the goods and factors markets I would suggest not raising the wage rate."}

{"question":"What was your biggest investing mistake? Typically, we tend to talk more about what's going well, or successes when finding an undervalued company which gives back great returns, but less about when it all goes wrong. It would be interesting to see what some of your biggest mistakes were, specific companies or otherwise, and what you learnt from them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, mine was buying FastJet years ago when I just started to understand what investing was. Following some very brief DD online, it looked like a gem - input from Stelios (founder of EasyJet), was an actual already-flying company, and it was branching off into different countries in Southern Africa, trying to capitalise on rising middle classes keen to travel and fly in a region which historically has had disproportionately high fares. Unfortunately, for a few different reasons including difficulty in getting slots and permissions to expand, along with never really increasing it's fleet size, it kept sinking, and delisted off the stock exchange last August. I bought and sold years before that, but still lost a bit. Lesson learnt? If something looks a sure fire winner, it's still important to spend a little time thinking about why it could all go wrong, and take the critical approach before jumping in. Sounds obvious, but that was a lived lesson which kept me grounded in future investing decisions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: Thanks kind strangers for the awards!

So the the UI is good and fees essentially non-existent.","answer":"Fees are very far from non-existant. They are just very well hidden. OTC trade fees are $6.95 a trade(Buy or Sell). There is also a $38 fee if a stock you own does a reverse split, share buy back, and a couple other things but I can't remember if the top of my head what those are. They have shit customer support. My wife has an account and use to be bought into a Canadian silver mining company (OTC-AVLNF). $AVLNF did a mandatory buy back a little while back for all their paper and non-brokerage shares. It was clearly stated that the buy back was optional for shares owned through a brokerage. When time came, all of a sudden her shares were gone and she was hit with the $38 fee.

{"question":"You can avoid paying rent altogether if you do your research. Some apartment complexes will let you live rent free if you work full-time or if you're lucky, part-time; Front office work or maintenance work is available for this opportunity My brother just started attending a university and wasn't necessarily looking for a job. He has Florida prepaid, so he isn't stressing about paying for tuition but like most, one of his biggest expenses is living expenses. Long story short, he heard from one of his neighbors that the complex was hiring a part time position, he interviewed for it and they told him they would comp his whole rent (650\/month) if he averaged 18 hours per week working at the front desk. It was a no brainer, even though he takes a full workload at school (12 credit hours), they informed him that they would work around his schedule.\n\nFast forward one month later. He tells me the job is easy breezey and sometimes he even manages time to get some studying in while at work. I'm a PCU Nurse paying 950\/ month for rent and the only thing I'm thinking is,\"how can I hop on this gravy train\". I went to my front office manager in my apt complex and asked if they are looking for extra help, they inform me that they want to remain open on the weekends and have been looking for some front desk personnel for the last couple of months. Shortly after, they offer me a part time position where I come in Saturday and Sundays only for 6 hours a day (12 hours total, 2 days a week). I don't know if I'll accept the position or not, but it's a great option to have for a variety of reasons, one of which is to save thebmoney and hopefully buy a house.\n\nI just reminisce and think back to when I was in college for 6 years. If I knew that there were opportunities like this, I would've made a lot of changes to my working lifestyle, probably stopped working 4-5 days a week serving\/bartending , trying to pay for rent. You don't have to be a student for these benefits obviously, but you do have to do some research and make some calls to see what apartments are offering. \n\nMy personal advice to anyone struggling to pay rent is to just take a day or two to yourself, research all apartments hiring (preferably close to where you work so you can knock out other expenses, like gas and car maintenance). Also, call apartments that include specific or all utilities ( water, sewer, trash, electricity) first; This will also help compartmentalize your expenses. Most importantly, in my opinion , is that YOU DON'T NEED PRIOR EXPERIENCE FOR MOST OF THESE JOBS. My brother, god bless his soul, is lazy as hell and only works when absolutely necessary. He had no job experience before this, let alone front office experience. Not all apartments are the same, so they may offer you reduced Rent with pay instead of the fully comped rent as previously stated. Write these places down, but don't stop looking for the places that offer fully comped rent. I assure you, they are out there, you just have to really dig to find them. If all else fails, go to your local hud housing department And see if you qualify for a section 8 housing grant, which pays for your rent in full if you and your household fall below a county-indicated poverty line ( our qualifying poverty line Is 150%, or a little over 18k for one person, 24,640 for a 2 person household). This is just one of the many aids to help you out with housing, if you don't qualify for the full grant, you may qualify for a section 8 voucher or section 8 housing. \n\nAlso, side note, just because an apartment complex indicates it's a \"student housing\" complex specifically doesn't mean there is an age limit or you even have to be attending a school. Sometimes this just indicates that each room in an apartment is individually leased and that all occupants share a living common area and possibly a bathroom or 2, depending on the apartment layout. Don't leave these apartments out of your research, as these apartments most often offer fully comped rent, at least in my area.\n\nFor reference, My brother is getting paid exactly $9.60\/hour at his front desk job and saves $7,800 a year in rent; I've been offered a wage of $10.00\/hr and if I accept the position, I'll be saving $11,400 a year in rent.","answer":"This will probably be one of the most important subreddits to me on this whole site.

{"question":"Just got back from H&amp;R Block. Instead of a $1000 refund I was told that someone else has claimed my 4-year-old son as a dependent and that I need to pay H&amp;R Block almost $600. **Edit: To clarify, there is no one else that should have my son's SSN or other personal info. The other parent is not in the picture and my own parents have never claimed my child nor do they have access to any of his info.**\n\n\nSorry for the long post guys, my head is still spinning...\n\nSo I filed taxes for the first time in two years today (previously unemployed) and went to H&amp;R block at the recommendation of a family member. I'm self-employed so the tax preparer did what seemed to be a fairly straight forward Schedule C. My federal refund came out to $1001 and I owed $353 in state taxes, so I was coming out better than I had anticipated. Then, as we were wrapping up, I was told that my H&amp;R Block fees were $567.95 - yikes! Still, I was coming out a little ahead and took that as a hard lesson learned that I should be better prepared to do my own taxes next year or at least take advantage of other resources that wouldn't take such a huge chunk of my return.\n\nA couple of hours later I get a phone call from H&amp;R Block to inform me that my refund was rejected because someone else has already claimed my son for the EIC\/Child credit. The lady who had prepared my taxes told me that I needed to bring in some documentation proving I was the sole caretaker of my son (she suggested social security card and daycare statements) and she'd give me a letter to send to the IRS along with them. She warned me that my refund would take a \"very long time\" to come through and that I needed to go ahead and bring her fee this week when I come from the letter. \n\nRight now I'm panicking and don't even know where to start.. I'm just getting back on my feet and as the sole provider of my kid I don't really have a spare $600 laying around. I guess I have three questions:\n\n**Is there anyway to get out of paying the H&amp;R Block fee at this point?** I'm thinking the answer is no. I'm going through the paperwork and looking to see if I've signed anything stating that I owe them even if my refund is rejected. I haven't seen anything stating that yet, but I'm sure there's something along those lines in the fine print. Do I have any options other than trying to negotiate for a reduced fee?\n\n**What do I need to prove that I'm the sole provider for my son?** Any specific documents that would be of help? Is there anything I can do to speed up this process? Can I keep this from happening again? I'm really curious about how my son's information was found in the first place... his father has never been in the picture and has no knowledge or access to any of our personal info.\n\n**How worried to I need to be about my son's financial identity being used in other fraudulent ways?** As soon as I post this I'm going to pull his credit reports and look for anything suspicious (he's four, so they should be totally blank right?) and I'm considering putting a freeze on them. Are there any other steps I should take to protect his identity?\n\n**tl;dr Someone has claimed my son as a dependent on their taxes so H&amp;R Block is asking for their filing fees upfront - which I don't have. How do I prove that my son is my dependent, protect his identity and wiggle my way out of the outrageous fees H&amp;R Block wants?**","answer":"IRS employee here:\n\nHowever you accomplish the task, your 2014 return needs to be complete and correct when you file it. Do not take your son off of the original return, and amend later adding him back on.\n\nDo not add any documentation or paperwork showing \"sole caretaker\".\n\nFile your complete and correct return by mail, and allow eight weeks for processing. Be sure your documents that show federal withholding (Forms W-2) are attached, as well as the supporting forms and schedules. Triple-check your refund direct deposit information. No cover letter, no breath mints. \n\nThe Service processes your return and pays your refund.\n\nIn September-ish of this year, our Very Old Computer (VOC) runs all the tax returns through a filter and picks up the same dependent claimed on two or more returns. The VOC generates out notices CP 087 to both parties. The notice does not determine who is right or wrong, and it asks both parties to review their returns and be sure they were entitled to claim the dependent. The notice advises the Taxpayer who claimed the dependent in error to amend their return, which would generally result in a balance due. The notice advises the Taxpayer who correctly claimed the dependent **to do nothing.**\n\nIf neither Taxpayer amends, both returns could be selected for examination. The Service would ask both parties to provide proof that they met the tests to claim the dependent. Since you were the only Taxpayer who could do so, your tax return is unchanged. The other party would then be assessed the tax, penalties, and interest, and face a possible ban from claiming certain credits on future returns.\n\nAt no point will an IRS notice or employee provide information to you from the other return.\n\nThank you for reading."}

It took him 15yrs but he\u2019s now working part time.\n\nYes - shit happens, there are emergencies and problems and it took him 15yrs but again - the guy is totally free outside of these monthly or bi-monthly fires.\n\nHis day to day is basically retirement - he surfs during in the morning, he goes to BJJ 5x a week, spends 2hrs in the office socializing with staff and on occasion meets with customers to maintain relationships.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t want to spend 10-15yrs building up a business like his but I could see myself buying an existing bussiness instead and wanted to know what you all think are low stress, low maintenance businesses one can buy?\n\nI know nothing is prefect - I know eventually a problem will arise.  \n\nBut my desire with FIRE is to just have more day to day freedom,  if I can get things to where I\u2019m just working 10-15hrs a week and maintain my current lifestyle I think that sounds more interesting than full blown retirement.\n\nI\u2019m aware about the need to due diligence with lawyers, CPAs etc but what are some businesses that can cash flow well but can be relatively low maintenance?\n\nReal estate immediately comes to mind - but I\u2019m wondering what else there is.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014 (updating the post) \u2014\u2014\u2014- \n\nOk - looking at the responses I don\u2019t think I put a proper disclaimer here.

Right now my day job is very demanding, I have little work life balance and switching to another tech company or whatever doesn\u2019t seem appealing to me.","answer":"A business that's mostly hands-off for the owner is only successful because of the employees who do the day-to-day work. If key employees leave, you're basically fucked if you don't understand the business well enough to train new people. The person who founded the business would have no problem finding\/training the right person. If you just bought the business then you might not have any idea what to look for.\n\nIf you do buy a hands-off business, you'd still want to spend weeks or months shadowing people and doing all of the jobs just so you know exactly what everyone does. This is really important in case you lose an employee and have to do the work yourself until you find a replacement. And you still need to show up occasionally and make sure people are... you know... working."}

Shares in Nikola meanwhile have collapsed from the $70s to less than $20 amid fraud allegations and the departure of Milton.\n\nAlso:\n\n&gt; Healy\u2019s e-axle evolved into a complete drivetrain system that Hyliion calls the Hypertruck ERX. Replacing the diesel engine is a bank of electric batteries, which are charged via onboard generators that run on tanks of compressed natural gas.

The CPA was confused about some records, and I had to convince him to Google \"mega back door Roth\" as well as \"custodial Roth.\" I realize that neither of these is something that the standard suburban household would use and that we have a rather dorky obsession with reading Mr Money Mustache and related niche sites. However, it surprised me that he had never heard of these strategies. Should these sorts of things be in the wheelhouse for a CPA?\n\nFor the record, we have used this CPA for several years after ashtrays doing our taxes ourselves until a particularly complicated year when he not only worked out the complications with ease but also introduced us to quite a few deductions that we had no clue about. He has saved us well more than his $200 fee every year, and I have never questioned his abilities, and I am not exactly questioning now much but am mostly curious if my surprise is warranted.","answer":"CPA is a license, just like lawyers and doctors have to get license to practice. Just like not all the doctors and lawyers are the same (i.e. some are better than others), not all CPAs are the same.

{"question":"What to do in the new tax year? Overpay mortgage, invest in possibly overinflated market or keep somewhere ready to invest? I have just bought a residential  property and  started a new mortgage this year. I foolishly opted for a 5 year fixed term with an interest of 2.66%.

Of course. But \"wait until there is a market correction\" is...not a good idea. Because you might be waiting forever. Markets, long term, always trend upwards. There's no real evidence that \"now\" is the peak, and a crash is looming. It might keep growing another 20% over however long, *then* have a correction of 10%, and you've missed out on 10% growth.

Started my career at $60k\/year after graduate school, now at $400k+ income.   Annual expenses $80k at MCOL place.  From aggressive allocation over the last decade, have about 40% cash and bonds now (60% equities).  Still nervous about the frothy market while pandemic is ravaging the real economy.  Hoping to FIRE at 55 or at $5 m net worth, whichever comes first.\n\nupdate 4\/15\/21:  Hard to believe it.  In just over 7 months, NW hit a new milestone of $5 million, still shy of 50!  The markets have been kind but I remind myself that things can change.  These are just numbers.   Plan to continue working till 53 at least to give more cushion considering today's peak market.  ","answer":"Congratulations!  You\u2019ll hit $5M no problem and cruise right past $6M as well...and guess what: it won\u2019t feel any different than the level of wealth you have right now.  Make sure to enjoy the ride along the way to 55 or whenever you pull the working plug, you already have enough and we never know when life throws us a curveball."}
{"question":"How exactly do you guys take profits? This isn\u2019t satire I swear. Do you guys move your profits into a stablecoin or straight into your bank accounts? Do you move strictly profits and leave what you came in at, or do you take everything and wait to re enter? Do you move profits from smaller coins into ETH and BTC? Do you just hodl for long term despite profits? Or does it depend on the coin? Are you like me and haven\u2019t been in any real profit to even think about it? I got in about 3 weeks ago and I am about even right now after the dip, right after I yeeted some of my savings into crypto.","answer":"I generally have a goal for X amount of coins. This is usually double the minimum to stake that coin. If it doesn't have a minimum to stake the goal will be 200 and add zeros as necessary. \n\nWhen (if) it doubles in value, I take out my seed money and either stake it in crypto.com app as usdc for 12% a.p. or reinvest in a new small cap token or CRO, ETH, BNB, and BTC. Sometimes I will divide it equally to all those. \n\nThen I stake the remainder that is left and just let it ride, because it is house money at that point. If it does well, I wait for a dip and buy again until I have enough to stake again. I set up a ladders so that I have multiple stakes in the same coin that pay out at different times. This ensures I constantly have income coming in at different pay periods. I compound that income back into the staked coins at the end of every month or when the staking goal has been met..\n\nIf at any point I need money, I use the coins that have not yet been put into staking. These are the coins that have been acquired through the staking process, redistributions from defi coins, the new seed money that I invest weekly, and if it's an emergency any money held in USDC. \n\nAny money held in staked coins doesn't exist to me at all. It is there to make money. I pretend I used it to get blacked out drunk and it no longer exists. I always renew my staking once the staking period is over.\n\nIf something stupid happens and I 10x - 100x, and it is above or close to ATH, I will take 50% profit to USDC or move it to one of my dividend paying stonks. Anything that goes to stonks is also money that is no longer playable. It becomes a generator of dividends. \n\nI generally will not invest in a coin if it is within 30% of it ATH. Because it is to close to the top and will dump as soon as I buy in. If it is a coin I want, I will put it on my watchlist. Set an alarm, and I will wait until it dips. I don't use buy or sell limit stops. It takes the fun out of it for me."}
{"question":"My car value went up and I sold it. So a bit of backstory. in June of 2020, I bought a 2019 Toyota Camry LE for 16K from a dealership. It had 19k miles and was exactly what I wanted. My previous vehicle had been totaled in a hail storm so between that, and what I had saved, I only had to take out a 6k loan. I worked hard and had the 6k paid off in 8 months.\n\nI graduated in 2020 with a bachelors in computer science, and now have a remote job making 40k per year, which is pretty good for where I live. Even working through collage, and having 50% of my school paid via a grade based scholarship, I still have 28k in student debt.\n\nThen the Covid hits, and my loans are now on pause until spring. So I start to save, and manage to get 8k in savings. Also because of Covid used cars go up in value crazy high. My 2019 Camry I bought for 16k now is worth 26k even though it has 12k more miles and is 1.5 years older.\n\nSo I sold it, and now have 34k in my money market account at .3% interest, but my only car it a old beater that need a couple hundred in repairs.\n\nThe money from my car sale  is in there (making $90 per month) until my student loans come due in May, then I will pay it off. Which will still leave me 6k to buy a decent car, if I save nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am worried about the car market not going down, and having to buy back in high. Was this a smart move? What is your opinion? Let me know if I screwed up.\n\nThanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nCan anyone confirm my math\n\n10k profit + 40k wages - standard deduction of 12k = 38k taxable income, which is below the minimum threshold for capital gains taxes correct?\n\nalso I will have a couple thousand in charitable contributions, so can I use that and the standard deductions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2, I know my math on .3% of 29k is wrong","answer":"Right now used cars are worth more than new cars. That isn't sustainable. When it will end is anyone's guess.\n\nYou followed the number 1 rule of investing (albeit on an uncommon commodity), buy low sell high. NEVER be upset with a profit, that's how you avoid greed.\n\nMax out your Roth IRA. Invest 100% of it in VTI or the SnP500. Invest in your roth 401k, same ETFs.\n\nYou can always take your contributions out of your Roth IRA tax and penalty free at any point in your life (ie home purchase).\n\nFor now buy a reliable 6k Japanese car and watch your money grow.\n\nWhatever you do don't sell if the stock market goes down. People get nervous that it will go lower and trick themselves into losing money. In fact, try to buy more and more as it dips, be patient, it WILL go back up and then some.\n\nGood luck!"}

{"question":"Would I be doing myself a disservice financially if I never invest in shares or ETFs outside super ? Morning everyone hope you are all enjoying your weekend,\n\n\nI think I've been in the ausfinance bubble long enough to forget that outside of this sub not many people invest in shares\/ETF's and it feels like if I don't invest in ETF's or shares I will be shooting myself in the foot financially.\n\n\nAs I was drawing up my future budget I realised that if I am saving for a house deposit (on my own) then I will be keeping my money in a HISA  and when I do get a mortgage Ill be shoving money into a offset account instead. So I don't think I will ever have the time or opportunity to invest  meaning I will be missing out on market gains and compound interest. Well unless I shove more money into super. \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts\/advice on this ? Do some of you save for both a deposit and portfolio at once ? Do you feel financially secure even if you don't invest in shares ?

I think age also plays a part - when I was 39 retirement seemed a very long way away - but the day I turned 40 I panicked about not having put enough into Super :) \n\nBut there was something to be said for having a zero minimum required mortgage payment!"}
{"question":"Read 'The Intelligent Investor' &amp; Sold my Portfolio Afterwards I just finished reading '*The Intelligent Investor*' from Benjamin Graham. Afterwards, I tried my best to put Graham's advice into practice and analysed my portfolio thoroughly. As a sidenote, my portfolio was all US stocks (50% NASDAQ-100 and 50% single tech stocks as AMD, NVID, AMZN, ...). I looked at the balance sheets of the respective companies for the first time, with Graham's words in the back of my mind. After 2 days of analysis, I decided that none of my holdings is worth to hold at its current price. Sure, all of them are really good companies with great future prospects, but they are simply way too overpriced.\n\nOne sentences from Graham sticked to my mind the most:\n\n**The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.**\n\nThat sentence really hit me. It reminded me of the unrealistic optimism among todays \"investors\" that is most embodied in meme sentences like \"sto\\*\\*s only go up\", \"buy the dip\", and so on and so forth. It really made me realize that this whole game is really just nothing but a game anymore, pure speculation from people relying on the FED to keep their gains growing for another couple of month, before eventually everything has to fall apart.\n\nI think selling my positions was the right move as the market seems to be unsustainable and flooded by optimists these days. I know, timing the market is not Graham's advice either, but he certainly does not recommend a \"never sell anything and always try to buy the dip after a 5% correction\" strategy that most people promote on reddit these days. I feel smart and reliefed after selling to optimists.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Did I made a foolish move based on outdated knowledge? Will I get the opportunity to buy from pessimists in the next two years?","answer":"The thing is, just because a stock is overpriced doesn't mean it's headed for a selloff.  That's your mistake.  When stocks go parabolic, they sell off hard (TSLA anyone?).  But when the climb is a bit more reasonable, good stocks will often just consolidate - that means they will trade sideways and in a range for a while, forming a base while the financials catch up.  If you're a long-term investor in these stocks, there's no reason to sell them just because they're overpriced - they may just be due for a rest.\n\nThink about it this way.  The general methods of determining the value of a stock is using ratios like P\/S, P\/E, PEG, etc.  The important thing about these ratios is that they are fractions, and there are two ways they can change: either the numerator changes (the price of the stock) or the denominator changes (sales\/earnings change).  If the price gets ahead of the sales\/earnings that doesn't mean the price necessarily has to come back down to a more reasonable ratio.  The price could stay where it is while the sales\/earnings increase to bring the ratio into alignment."}

The farewell party was more fun and less awkward than I had feared.\n\nI'm about as stereotypical as it gets on this sub. 37M engineer, 15 year career doing R&amp;D for a giant corporation. Wife worked for the first couple years, then was a SAHM for our 4 kids. I went to school on a scholarship but my parents gave me the money they had saved for my college anyway, so between that and the second income for a few years we had a huge headstart.

{"question":"How I Bought a House at 21 Working at McDonalds tl;dr: Bought a small 2-bedroom unit for 200k in Adelaide. Saved 80k for deposit by working 3 fast food jobs concurrently (50+ hours a week) and going to uni full-time.\n\n**Firstly, why?**\n\nThere\u2019s a LOT of information out there saying why you *shouldn\u2019t* buy property at a young age. But for me, I was interested in buying as I would prefer to spend money on a mortgage rather than paying the same amount in rent. It\u2019s not something I would recommend to everyone but I am happy with my decision as it fits my personal circumstances.\n\n**Secondly, HOW?**\n\nI\u2019ve been saving for a deposit since I was 15 so my savings rate varied a lot (at first I was only earning $9 per hour), but usually I tried to save about 2k per month. My expenses were $300 per week ($150 in rent as I live with 3 other people), $50 on food and $100 towards bills \/ petrol \/ rego \/ etc. Sometimes I will spend more on food if I\u2019ve had a difficult week but I try to save as much as I can.\n\nBeing a low-income, single person on an unstable, casual income (with full-time uni study as well) meant that saving for a deposit took a LOT of hard work. It meant working an 8 hour shift at one restaurant and then going straight to an 10 hour shift at another restaurant and then going to home to study for an exam the next day. It meant surviving off leftover fries and 3 instant coffees a day rather than spending money on food. It meant taking the bus for 2 hours (and watching uni lectures at the same time, of course) instead of buying petrol.\n\nTechnically, you are not supposed to work at more than 1 fast-food place at a time (because they are competitors), but I just didn't tell my bosses. It was a bit tricky to make sure all my shifts were at different times, so I had to do a lot of swapping shifts and moving things around.\n\nRight before I applied for the loan, I got a promotion at one of my jobs, to a management position, so I had 1 full-time job only (otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have been approved).\n\n**How did you work so much while also attending uni?**\n\nI barely attended any physical tutorials or lectures. I just studied at home (usually between 2am-5am after getting home from work), submitted my assignments and that was that.\n\n**That sounds terrible!! Didn\u2019t you burnout? Don\u2019t you want to enjoy your youth?**\n\nNo. I\u2019m a machine, baby.\n\nHa ha. Just kidding. Yes, it was bloody EXHAUSTING (working 14 hour shifts without any breaks, food or water), but overall, I\u2019m glad I did it. I genuinely loved my job (working in fast food is HARD but it\u2019s also really rewarding) and I love knowing that I\u2019m paying off my own mortgage rather than paying off someone else\u2019s.\n\n**Do you have any tips for other young people in a similar situation?**\n\nFirstly, comparison is the theft of joy. While I was busy busting my ass to buy a tiny unit with barely any windows, I also have a few friends who\u2019s parents bought them a house, despite never having paid for anything or worked a day in their life. It can be easy to feel frustrated at this, but keep at it! It\u2019s impossible to be \u201cbehind\u201d in life when nobody starts from the same place.\n\nSecondly, there\u2019s a reason why \u201cmake a budget\u201d is at the top of every one of those \u201chow to buy a house\u201d articles on Domain. I like to track my actual vs planned expenses on Excel (I love Excel) to see where I can save money. I\u2019m also a big fan of repayment calculators.\n\nThirdly, do your research on the property market. Real estate agents and banks were VERY rude and condescending (because of my age and occupation), so coming prepared will show them that you mean business! Often real estate agents would refuse to talk to me or give me one-word answers which I thought was quite rude. Research as much as you can and come to your bank appointments prepared with all the necessary documents. You want to make it EASY for them to approve your loan. Make sure you understand the property buying process and know how to make an offer.\n\nPersonally, I didn\u2019t bother with a broker as I did lots of research on the best home loan for my situation and then just went directly to that particular bank.\n\n**To clarify:** (Edit) I have a fantastic life. I love my job, it gives me real purpose and joy. I have a beautiful girlfriend, who I see everyday, and amazing friends, who I see at least once a week.\n\nI do have hobbies. I go for a run everyday, which I love, and I'm studying French. I do really well in university and have won several awards, including a scholarship. Before the pandemic, I travelled overseas several times a year, which I love.\n\nFor me, everything was worth it. I love my little apartment and it's been so fun to decorate it and invite friends over. I love having my own space.","answer":"This is a positive result for OP, and props to him for working so hard.

{"question":"Gamers aren't against NFTs. They're against microtransactions cash-grabs. Last year, several gaming studios announced plans to roll-out NFTs on their platforms, and the backlash was swift. Gamers threatened to cancel their Discord membership, Square Enix got criticized for introducing NFTs in *Kingdom Hearts*, Ubisoft got panned for a similar NFT program last month...\n\nAt first, I was aghast. Why would gamers reject so violently a new technology? I am not a gamer myself, so it was troubling.\n\nBut I read about it, and I came to this conclusion : gamers are not against to NFTs, they are against microtransactions cash-grabs. And to them, non-fungible tokens are nothing more than another way for studios to make more money. But this will change.\n\nFrom what I read, the gaming industry has been plagued by microtransactions for quite some time now. You pay $60 for a game, and yet, you need to fork out more money to buy clothes, armor, weapons, etc., for your character. That pisses off players, and rightly so. So when big studios such as Square Enix or Ubisoft announced plans to offer NFTs, those same gamers are pissed off : they only see this technology as another form of microtransactions.\n\n(There are also energy consumption concerns, but as most NFTs are build on Ethereum, those concerns will evaporate in six months when it switch to proof-of-stake.)\n\n**That's why I think that, in the long-term, NFTs will find a way into the gaming industry.** When\/if big studios find ways to make it enticing for players, the revolution will begin.

He\u2019s really lost his way.\u201d\n\nGeorge has spent the past 20 years studying leadership failures in the workplace, recently compiling those findings into a new book called, \u201cTrue North: Leading Authentically in Today\u2019s Workplace, Emerging Leader Edition.\u201d\n\nIn short, George says bosses that lose sight of their most deeply held beliefs, values and purpose as a leader \u2014 especially in the name of money, fame or power \u2014 are doomed to fail. And after decades of researching high-profile corporate collapses, he says he sees striking similarities to Zuckerberg and Meta today.\n\nZuckerberg and Meta did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It\u2019s request for comment. The Meta CEO is largely responsible for his company\u2019s meteoric growth to this point, transforming the company he co-founded in 2004 into a tech giant with a $450.46 billion market cap, as of Monday morning.\n\nIn doing so, he helped create the modern-day social media industry \u2014 a move he\u2019s attempting to replicate now by repositioning his company into the metaverse space.

{"question":"how do credit unions compare? How do credit unions compare in comparison to traditional banks in terms of their outcome, survivability, are there significant differences in how they allocate resources and investments, and what is your personal opinion on them?","answer":"Fundamentally, credit unions and banks are very similar. They take deposits and use those funds to make loans. There are differences in the incentive set that they see though. Banks are for profit businesses owned by their shareholders that expect to be compensated for their ownership through dividends and appreciating stock prices. Credit unions are not-for-profit institutions owned by their membership. Credit unions don't (typically) compensate their ownership through dividends, but by offering lower loan rates &amp; fees, and higher deposit rates. \n\nWith credit unions being not-for-profit, they are not subject to the corporate taxes that banks are, which may create an imbalance in the competitive nature between banks and credit unions.\n\nThe other difference being that credit unions can't access additional funding by issuing new stock (except for what occurs through membership growth.) Additionally, credit unions don't have access to discount window borrowing from the Fed, and instead can achieve emergency credit through the Central Liquidity Facility administered by the NCUA, which typically charges higher rates than the discount window.\n\nI'm not aware of any research that examines the difference in investment strategies between the two, but anectdollaly, credit unions tend to have more conservative investment portfolios than banks. This may be from a lack of talent credit unions rather than a strategic decision."}

Hi everyone,\n\nI'm having troubles deciding what to do with my money.\n\nI started investing in ETFs (boring S&amp;P500 and World ETFs) in March 2020 and started with around 350\u20ac every month.\n\nHowever, I have a bit more than 80K saved in the bank (growing every month by 1-2K) and I feel like they are wasted and could be better utilized.\n\nAs a result, I've started increasing my investments in ETFs to around 700\u20ac per month, but I still feel like the vast majority of my money is sitting in a 0.01% interest bank account and should instead at least be partially invested.\n\nI will keep at the very least 20K in cash for sure, as an emergency fund, but I'm trying to decide what would be the best investment options.\n\nNote that I'm in Luxembourg, so buying a property to rent is absolutely not possible because of insane prices, but on the other side there are no taxes on capital gains. That said it is likely that I would move to another country in the next few years (no target yet).\n\nThanks for your help","answer":"How much you put depends on when you need the money and how you feel about risk. If you can wait 10-20+ years for any crises to blow over, you can put 70%+ in. If you want to get a mortgage in five years and you need it for the deposit, better keep most of it in cash, or you'll have to delay buying a house if there's a crisis.\n\nStatistically it's better to invest as a lump sum but it might be more comfortable to put it in gradually (dollar cost averaging(."}

{"question":"Is it time to drop drinking stocks by SIP - Vivek Kaul [https:\/\/vivekkaul.com\/2020\/08\/20\/is-it-time-to-stop-drinking-stocks-sip-by-sip\/](https:\/\/vivekkaul.com\/2020\/08\/20\/is-it-time-to-stop-drinking-stocks-sip-by-sip\/)  \n\n\nI personally agree with what Vivek has elucidated in the above article. Just wanted to know what all of you think about it.","answer":"Fairly bizarre article. Lots of good points rounded off by a truly bizarre conclusion. \n\n&gt;If as an investor you feel that stock prices will only go up from here despite the lack of company earnings, then you are better buying stocks directly and making irregular one-time investments into equity mutual funds than going through the SIP route. By going through the SIP route, you will keep escalating the cost of purchase of mutual fund units and in the process drive down returns.\n\n\nSo the author is saying that the funds are due for a correction\/crash, but individual stocks would somehow be spared? \n\nAnd that after he (rightfully) says:\n\n\n&gt;Also, since most retail investors don\u2019 know exactly when the stock market is going to fall (this is not to say that the so-called experts and talking heads on TV, do), an SIP strategy needs the investor to keep investing for the long term. \n\nAnd yet the author thinks that somehow its now predictable by a retain investor that there will be a crash (as opposed to a sideways or volatile sideways market where sips would still not be a bad bet)? \n\n\nGood and factual article if you simply ignore the conclusions which don't make much sense. Being early in the market is often the same as being wrong."}

{"question":"What does the \"dow\" going up or down mean in laymans terms? I always get alerts from my WSJ App about it andi have never really understood what it meant for the economy. Most articles i find have to much jargon to be easily understood. What does this big 800 point drop represent?","answer":"The dow is the dow jones industrial average which is an index for the value of a select group of 30 companies' stock prices. So if their prices trend up on average so does the dow. So it's a measure of some stock performance NOT a direct measure of how the economy is doing though if the economy is doing worse often times the stocks are going down."}
{"question":"What percentage of take home pay should a cat payment be? I have always bought cars with cash up front used. But I'm friends with a car dealership finance worker who says that the car payments typically work out to about 20% of take home pay because they qualify people for loans with pre tax income. \n\nI feel this is predatory and he is biased because he makes commissions on larger sales. Am I weird and just don't understand the economics of buying a new car?\n\n\nEdit: I'm sorry I meant car everyone. I do understand that cats do not need financing.","answer":"Heads up, the responses you will get from this community will not be \"typical.\"\n\nSpend enough time here and you'll find people making $200,000\/yr driving a 15 year old Honda as if that is normal. It's not. And while it's not a bad idea, it's not normal.\n\nNow, I'm confused by your question. Are you asking if he is lying to you? Sounds like his statement is coming from the angle of \"I see this\" aka anecdotal and there is no reason to think he is lying. I think he is leaving stuff out, like debt-to-income ratio, but if the median income in America is $67,000, after-tax and healthcare the take-home could be around $4500\/mo. 20% of that is $900\/mo. A 7% interest rate (average credit) on a $35,000 car is a $600\/mo payment on a 72-month loan. Assuming that is a family who wants\/needs a family car like a minivan or truck, payment could easily reach $900\/mo or more ($50k @ 7% for 72 mo = $865\/mo).\n\nNow, is that smart? Hell no. But a lot of people aren't smart with money. I don't think your car salesman friend is saying \"20% is smart financially\" but \"20% is what I typically see\" and I have no reason to not believe him when I look to the driveway of my sister with loans on a Tundra and Explorer."}

In the weeks since, this has become common knowledge in the community and it seems to have opened many questions and spurred a few interesting DDs (including making the connection that T-Bonds are feeding the RRP machine since they are considered adequate collateral for ONRRP).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/64d42rw2g9871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89987969c027febb2a87507cc4c75d31f14558a3\n\nThere has also been a lot of talk (and FUD) about Trading 212 and their share lending policy. While it appears to be true that you cannot opt out of the share lending program (unless you have an ISA account, in which case, you are exempt and your shares are safe), it has been used to create a LOT of FUD.\n\nFirst of all, it is in the ToA as their client that they can lend your shares. This is part of their business model:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[credit u\\\/J5T94 ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rs7od0n8c9871.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fff3acd948aee5c9ce9a7efae2c039d4300ca77)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were several subsequent posts outlining what to do if you are a T212 customer, building on the FUD.\n\nWe aren't financial advisors here, so we really can't tell you what to do with your stock held in T212. But it has been pointed out that in order to *transfer* your shares, you must *sell* them (so you're essentially just transferring cash). So do with that info what you will.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor clarification, the mod team is discussing this T212 issue, though it seems pretty simple. Here's a comment from u\/atobitt:\n\n&gt;Several concerning things going on here.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Since brokers are able to provide US Treasuries (or cash) as collateral for lending out your shares, it seems really suspicious that the reverse repos are sky high right now. There could be a strong correlation between the number of shares being lent and the number of treasuries (through the RRP) used as collateral.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Furthermore, they don't make a \"moderate profit\" from share lending. According to Dr. T and Wes Christian (and I believe Carl Hagberg said it too) **share lending is the #1 revenue stream for many brokers.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes we have known this since January. But we have many new apes here learning the ropes and catching up on DD. TURN OFF MARGIN LENDING ON YOUR TRADE ACCOUNT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember that urgency and panic= FUD. If there's not an ACTUAL emergency going on, but a post is urging you to \"act now!!!\" it's relying on you to react on your feelings instead of logic. This is a classic shill tactic to prey on people (and a classic marketing tactic overall) so be sure to always give any urgent post an hour or 2, at least, to be peer-reviewed before reacting. 9\/10 these things turn out to be FUD.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wr1r7r8bd9871.jpg?width=618&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0505bf139c735140b267aa66e7084ebf9d88b8b9\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Routing Your Purchases through IEX\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been a hot minute since we discussed this, but it's worth repeating. Certain American brokers like [TD Ameritrade](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/mq8opq\/how_to_use_investors_exchange_iex_with_td\/) (idk of any European ones yet) allow you to route your shares purchased through various lit exchanges such as Investors Exchange (IEX). The purpose of doing this is to keep the transaction from routing through dark pools on OTC exchanges. Keeping your purchases on lit exchanges like IEX keeps HFTs (high frequency traders) from being able to get their hands on the transaction first and manipulate the trade- as Dave Lauer pointed out in his first AMA- and gives you a more quality transaction overall.\n\nThis topic came up again this morning with [this post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/oa7st6\/citadel_really_doesnt_like_iex_if_you_have_the\/) by [u\/Key\\_Coffee4941](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Key_Coffee4941\/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCitadel REEAAALLLLLYYYYY hates IEX apparently.

{"question":"What is an effective strategy for a freelancer or one-person business to pay less taxes? My country is doubling the taxes I will have to pay starting next year. Since I'm young, I only benefited from a low tax rate for half a year. I consider this extremely unfair considering all the people who have benefited from the system and have bought a lot of properties and acquired a lot of wealth. In comparison, I own no property and cannot afford any in the short term, as prices keep rising. To add insult to injury, in the future, there will also be discussions to change from a flat income tax rate to a progressive one, making paying taxes here even less attractive. The medical system and infrastructure are some of the worst in all of Europe, so there really is no benefit to this. The rich and political class have better ways to avoid paying anyway, such as by using tax havens.\n\n  \nI thought of two ways of paying fewer taxes: \n\n1. The first would be to open a shell company in a tax haven. All rich people and all politicians do it (which is why it will never be fixed.) I heard that in the US, even dentists do it, so surely there should be a way to achieve this. Maybe to some islands that have not been blacklisted by the EU, such as **the Cayman Islands, Jersey, the Bahamas, and the Isle of Man**. I do not know how to achieve this and what the drawbacks are (for example, how do you get your money out when you need it?). I would appreciate details from anyone who knows more. \n2. The second way would be to relocate to a country with a low tax rate. Depending on the country, how hard is it to obtain (tax) residency? What happens if the country you relocated to also increases its taxes in the near future? It's not a flexible solution such as a tax haven, which you can just change.  \n\n\nHas anyone resorted to or has plans to take any such drastic measures to reduce taxes? Could you describe in the comments how you have achieved this or what your plans are? Thanks!","answer":"Well, if it is Romania, I guess you will be able to register llc right?

{"question":"ORIGIN TRAIL $TRAC AND WHY THIS IS THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY SINCE BITCOIN ... $TRAC\n\nOrigin trail has been around a while.  Current market cap $55 M. So why is this a moonshot, well what I about about to tell you will explain if you are prepared to read for a few minutes. To cut to the chase this will be a multi billion dollar coin.\n\n$TRAC has been 10 years in the making. Origin trail is not a private company instead it is an open source code created by trace labs to tackle issue that have never been resolved.\n\nThe first project I will talk about they are collaborating with will be the biggest however they have several other huge projects this combined will put exceptional price discovery on $trac.\n\nOrigin trail have been working with GS1 for several years [https:\/\/www.gs1.org\/](https:\/\/www.gs1.org\/) . GS1 Are a not for profit organisation like Origin trail and trace labs. GS1 set global standards for global communication. They created the barcode, amongst other creations, in the 1970s and have been managing its global standards ever since. GS1 Are going to implement a new global standard see video - [https:\/\/youtu.be\/HDqzTbzabq0](https:\/\/youtu.be\/HDqzTbzabq0) . GS1 and Origin trail are creating a decentralised knowledge graph that will host every barcode item in circulation. Thats billions of products with massive amounts of transactions per day. It has not been rolled out yet however there is a big announcement on the 17th you should sign up to find more [https:\/\/liftoff.origintrail.io\/](https:\/\/liftoff.origintrail.io\/) This solution involves a decentralised data bank that can link every chain legacy and new to the knowledge graph. Think of it as a interoperable decentralised server that every company can tap into to log new products, enquire about products, records movements, audits, just about anything you can imagine. Oracle, SAP, Walmart, Pfizer, Pepsi, Vechain.. the list is endless, they will all use this as it will become a global standard. There has never before been a trusted way for different organisations to immediately share data with.\n\nSo how is this going to make $trac a moonshot - GS1 Have 2 MILLION Business clients they advise, also BSI [https:\/\/www.bsigroup.com\/en-GB\/about-bsi\/media-centre\/press-releases\/2019\/january\/bsi-partners-with-origintrail-to-develop-blockchain-enabled-solutions\/](https:\/\/www.bsigroup.com\/en-GB\/about-bsi\/media-centre\/press-releases\/2019\/january\/bsi-partners-with-origintrail-to-develop-blockchain-enabled-solutions\/)  will use this, they have 84,000 business clients. We are talking almost every serious company in the world. $trac will be used to pay for data enquiries ect via a fiat on ramp much like companies do to buy Oracle credits per say. This on ramp is a simple payment gateway, companies need know nothing about crypto as when they purchase data usage it is a auto market buy for $trac to pay the node runners. This will create immense buying pressure that will propel $trac regardless of bear or bull market. This will be the first truly mass adopted utility crypto. As the knowledge graph its self is not on the blockchain it can scale indefinitely. Thumbprints will be stored on chain instead. odn INFO - [https:\/\/tech.origintrail.io\/protocol](https:\/\/tech.origintrail.io\/protocol) .\n\nIn all my time researching projects I believe this is the one, guaranteed mass adoption.\n\nAnd to think this is just one of the projects that Origin Trail are working with. They have been selected to help build the next generation Internet and also Parity Polkadot on their solutions.\n\nDYOR and join the dots. Id encourage you to do it soon as once people understand what is happening, its implications it will blast off.\n\nThe team have over the years not pursued mass exchange listings as they know what the final goal will mean.

Just got me to thinking is it possible that putting too much into retirement accounts is a bad thing?","answer":"No. You can change your 401k contribution at any time with no additional cost, but selling a house isn\u2019t so easy. Saving for future retirement can be a bad thing if it\u2019s making you unhappy or causing problems in the present, but we all make our own choices."}
{"question":"I\u2019m a PinkPanda community member and want to talk about its success and future potential -- the chart is insane  \n\nHey everyone, I\u2019ve been investing on BSC for a while and I want to share something new with you. To be honest, I\u2019m usually very objective and dispassionate about investments, but something about the PinkPanda DeFi community has made me much more excited about it than anything before.\n\nIt\u2019s a utility coin for a mobile app on both iOS and Android that will support decentralized trading on BSC with 5x leverage. Like, TrustWallet but much much more powerful. And they released the FIRST VERSION OF THEIR MOBILE APP after only a week of development! I\u2019ve never downloaded an app so fast tbh. If this doesn\u2019t prove the credibility of the devs, nothing does. ALSO: the founder is doxxed.\n\nAnd, of course, the chart. It\u2019s a thing of otherworldly beauty. It goes up a shit ton, corrects a bit, and then keeps going up a shit ton more. The momentum is insane. Check it out yourself--you\u2019ll be shocked.\n\nNow, as I mentioned, the community is the best thing about this coin. Please just humor me and TRY IT--hop into the Telegram chat and see for yourself. These pandas are OBSESSED and are constantly chatting, shilling, and buying. \n\nWhy does everyone like pandas? Because they\u2019re calm, reassuring, steady, and cute. So is PinkPanda imo. I don\u2019t go to sleep worrying about my money. I sleep peacefully knowing that the Panda community has got my back.\n\nObvious stuff: contract renounced, LP locked, doxxed founder, audited by Dessert Finance.\n\n\ud83d\udcac TG: https:\/\/t.me\/PinkPandaDefi\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Website: https:\/\/pinkpanda.finance\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Contract: 0x631e1e455019c359b939fe214edc761d36bf6ad6","answer":"I am very involved in the PINK PANDA community for several reasons. One if the actual friends I've made since I joined this project, always active I look forward to talking to them every day. The general excitement I see in the telegram and discord is something I haven't encountered in the crypto space before. The involvement of the creator Papa Panda, putting himself out there by doxxing himself and holding impromptu AMA's each night on the telegram is super encouraging. The cause behind what we are doing is an awesome one, helping those out there who need it most, and it goes beyond just a financial endeavor. \n\nMerch is already being discussed among the devs who are also super communicative about whats on the roadmap and what's in the works.\n\nAll around I have nothing but faith in this project, the growth has been exponential, the community has been rock solid and strong. The leadership has been outstanding. With a 5x Leverage DEX in the works down the road, donations to cancer relief already implemented with communal polling in the works for the next major charity we donate to the future is bright. \n\nSeveral of us early adopters have already been discussing what we our plans are for gains, but myself I think I've found the coin I'm going to call home for years. Everytime I look at the little panda holding the coin, I think about a child suffering from cancer with on of those little panda teddy's in his arms, receiving treatment and medications this coin and its owners helped pay for. THAT'S what this is about to me and that's why I'm in the Pink Panda Army! Let's go PANDA'S!!!"}
{"question":"Can anyone explain why all September 17 options have entirely disappeared? #Edit 5:\n\nI've decided to remove the text in this post for now because the last thing I want to do is mislead anyone.

{"question":"Is anyone worried about Canadian banks Although the track record of Canadian banks such as rbc and td has been impressive. The current situation with real estate prices in Canada has me worried. Lots of things remind me of the 2008 u.s housing bubble and we all know how that ended.\n\nEdit\/\/\/\/ \nI never said I believe a crash as bad as 2008 is imminent for the Canadian banks. However for everyone saying the system is regulated enough for this not to happen and that lending regulations are to strict . I personally know lots of people in Toronto and Vancouver with million dollar mortgages and many of whom believe paying 1.3 million for a pretty shitty house is fine because it will be worth 1.5 in a couple years and whoever buys it then is also taking out a million dollar mortgage. So I don\u2019t think things are as regulated as all of you believe them to be otherwise I wouldn\u2019t expect this level of speculation.\n\n\nSecond edit\/\/\/\/ \nEveryone\u2019s overconfidence in our banking system is exactly what scares me.

{"question":"ADVICE. PLEASE READ If you have friends who appear to be living it up and always on expensive vacations. This is a continuation of an answer I just posted. I just saw someone post something and I remember having such a similar experience and jealousy ....until I learnt the truth , and I just want to share this wisdom with the community so that others don't get fooled like I was.\n\nWe grew up in a poor 3rd world country. Some of us moved to the USA, England and Canada.  And others  from our group seem to always be in vacation spots **all over the world.**  Their social media accounts are filled with beautiful pictures of them in bikini's in the most beautiful locations around the world, living it up.  They never explain what exactly their job is, and most of these girls have cut off contact with the rest of us, outside of basic comments like \"hi\" and \"thanks for the like\"\n\nI remember feeling constantly always jealous that I wasn't doing enough in my career, why can't I afford to vacation like that too ? If we're all the same age, and all came from the same poor country, how did they get so rich in their 20s , where most of us are still paying of student loans ?\n\nIt wasn't until I happened to meet one such woman, that I understood what it was. It was one fateful day that I met a girl at work who I recognized having seen all over social media, and I asked her how does it work. That's when she explained it for me. She even gave me a few pointers.\n\nIt was their job. They are models. There is an entire industry out there , of \"selling the dream life\"\n\nIt is supposed to give the impression, that they are always vacationing. That's why the captions are purposefully left vague. *These are not vacations, they are paid advertising campaigns*.\n\nShe explained to me that sometimes, she does several photo-shoots in a short space of time, but releases the photos over a period of months to give the impression that she has spent the whole year traveling. (obviously, maintaining this illusion requires keeping things vague when chatting online)\n\nShe said its all about the image, and that is why they purposefully never say that they are paid models, in their captions, because then it ruins the illusion of \"**the average woman taking vacation**\" that these companies are trying to sell.\n\nShe explained that even if the pictures make it appear like she's relaxing all day, many times its just a quick photo-shoot and then she has to rush to a next location  in the same day ....even if she releases the pictures months apart to give the impression that she is leisurely travelling around Europe, for example.\n\nI've literally seen her do this. One day during lunch break at the office, she showed me some pictures she was uploading , and i was like wow ! that's where you went last weekend ? And she said \"no, last weekend I was home, this picture is 2 years old.\"\n\nShe didn't stay at the office too long...but I'm thankful to have met her. At least now I understand better.\n\nSo please. If you are like me, and you have some old girlfriends (or guy friends) online who always seem to be vacationing... and it seems like  they spent the entire summer travelling across Europe. And you are wondering to yourself, how they can afford to travel to all these locations ? **They can't.**\n\nIt is job like any other. It is advertisement.\n\nSo please Do not be fooled into emptying your savings trying to keep up.","answer":"As a guy, I knew this girl who was married with 2 kids, to a dude who worked the night shift at a Circle K. She vanished for a month and when she came back, she told me they had a vacation in the Bahamas for a month just because they wanted to.\n\nThat's when I categorized her and her husband as being just financially stupid.\n\nSometimes that's what it is. Not everyone has a modeling job taking them all over the place. A majority of the time, it's someone putting all of these vacations on a credit card and showing off how interesting or cool they are. They're likely drowning in debt behind the scenes."}
{"question":"Can I contribute the full amount to the HSA I just opened? My company recently completed open enrollment for benefits. I was already on the HDHP, and stayed on it.

My company will not start distributing to the account from my paycheck until 2022 but I've opened the account.\n\nMy question is, similar to an IRA, can I contribute the full 2021 amount now?","answer":"Yes you can. And yes you should :). Just a piece of information: I observed in the past that there is a difference between payroll deduction and you contribute to it yourself. If it is payroll deduction, then FICA tax won't be charged on it either. So it is worth making sure next year you max it out via payroll deduction. But for this year, just contribute to it directly."}

{"question":"How do buy backs work? Unichem labs is offering a buy back soon, and I'm not sure I understand the procedure correctly. Would be great if someone could explain it to me!\n\nAlso, a few related questions:\n\n1. Should you tender your shares in buy back? As far as I understand, buy back only applies to people who already hold the shares, so it shouldn't drive the price up much. So, you can always buy back at a lower price or exit.\n\n2. How does it fare for the company, in short term and long term? ","answer":"Procedure: \n\n1. Buyback price, record date and size of the buyback is announced by company.\n\n2. Shareholders on the announced record date are eligible for the buyback, so typically after an announcement the price goes up as people buy to participate in the buyback, particularly if the buyback price is good and the overall buyback size will mean a high acceptance ratio.\n\n3. Buyback entitlement ratio is calculated based on buyback size and total freefloat of shares.\n\n4. Buyback window is fixed and (e)mails are sent out to shareholders with the tender form. Within the buyback window, they can tender shares either via their broker or directly with the RTA.\n\n5. Based on number of shares tendered, acceptance ratio is calculated and company \"accepts\" and extinguishes those shares. Rest of the tendered shares are returned if they were held in an escrow account.\n\nBuybacks are a great way to reward investors, even if you choose not to participate. The main reasons are :\n\n1. Buybacks decrease the P\/E of the company because they reduce the freefloat. In the medium term, the P\/E will normalize again effectively driving up the share price.\n\n2. As mentioned above, if the buyback price is high it drives up the share price because of obvious reasons\n\n3. Buyback shows that the company feels the market is undervaluing it. This is a show of confidence. The company is not going to overpay to buy its own shares. This confidence boosts positive sentiment among investors.\n\n\nShould you participate in buyback? It mainly depends on the price and acceptance ratio. I participated in the Infosys buyback for very rich profits. They had 50% acceptance ratio and buyback price was 25% above market price when I bought.\n\nMOIL on the other hand has a buyback price barely 3% above today's market price, and a low entitlement ratio. No sense in participating there."}
{"question":"Breaking the 30% housing rule but living next door to work?

I also use about 416 gallons of gas just for commuting to work, which costs about $1,100\/yr at the given rate. \n\n**My question is this: If my take home, after tax and deducion pay is roughly anywhere from $2350 on the low end(no commissions or overtime) to ~$3000(w\/ commissions or overtime or both) per month could I justify getting an apartment that is $1050\/mo that is quite literally a 20 second jog to my work building?** \n\nIt would cost me roughly $1800 ($700 after factoring gas) over the year to buy my time back and improve my quality of life if you consider the gas money goes straight into my pocket.

{"question":"Do you care about DRIPPING? I posted last week asking which stock to buy (BNS vs. NWH.UN) and I reasoned that one of my reasons for buying BNS was to DRIP at least one share per quarter. \n\nAnd this got me thinking: do you care a lot about DRIP that you buy enough shares to ensure you are covering the drip , at least for the short term? For example , if you think the BNS share price for the next 12 months will be $80-100, then you buy enough so that your quarterly dividend return more than covers that range. \n\nDoes this figure into your stock purchase decision making?","answer":"I did it for a long time and it was great. But now that my dividends are more significant, I prefer to get the cash so I can pick where I put my $10k at a time into.

And now it happen much more than most of us  ever experienced in our lives. In recent times inflation is highest since decades and it is just the beginning.\n\nBefore covid, few years ago it was rational to hold fiat and not be all in crypto. With inflation 1.5% or 2% yearly it was still rational decision to diversify and save some money. But it was before  2019 and is not actual info anymore.

Saving fiat is worst thing anyone can do. Have small emergency fund, but remember richest people do not hold much fiat.  They know it mean losing money.

Crypto can possibly go down, but I will trust all my money BTC or other good project  much more than I would ever trust them USD or any other fiat. Cause crypto can also go up a lot.

{"question":"How can the US reverse it\u2019s debt\/GDP trend? Federal debt to US GDP has reached almost 140 at this point. Most people heard about it but brushed it off as just being due to Covid.

Would love some insight from people that know more about fiscal policy.","answer":"The following variables determine the dynamics of debt\/GDP: primary fiscal balance (pb), nominal interest rate on government debt (i) and nominal GDP growth (g).\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if pb=0 and i=g, then debt\/GDP stays constant. The government has direct control on pb only. Its policies can indirectly affect i and g, but these are ultimately determined by the market conditions.\n\nIf g&lt;i or g=i, pb&gt;0 is needed to decrease debt\/GDP. If g&gt;i, it is great, because then pb=0 or even a small deficit can be sufficient to decrease the ratio. However, the U.S. primary deficits in the last two decades were not small ([see this](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/fredgraph.png?g=PKgu)). Even in a favorable scenario with g&gt;i, the primary deficit must be reduced significantly to improve the debt\/GDP ratio.

Hedgefunds can't even get the price lower anymore.\n\nAMC is not dipping anymore and is constantly attacked on discord and on this sub because they don't want you to see the potential.

People see AMC as a possibility down the line yes, but a lot of us are seeing out the GME play first because of all of the distraction stocks theyre pumping non stop. It is seen as luring us away for a pump and dump in order to cover their GME losses. \n\nJust my opinion, hang in there hopefully the bots go away once its over\n\nEdit: i like AMC, straight up with you.

{"question":"Options trading sounds good to be true im new to stocks and never traded options before\n\nok so i bought 10 $1 call for idex expiring for may 20th for $3 each\n\nso i basically risk $30 for a good chance to make 1k????\n\nso the max loss is $30 and max gain is 1k???? \n\nthis sounds too good to be true","answer":"You max gain potential is technically unlimited.\n\nThat said, a stock has yet to reach infinity dollars, and unless news comes out, you're likely just out $30.\n\nYou should learn about things before you buy them though. You bought the OPTION to purchase 100 shares (times 10 contracts, so 1,000 shares) of IDEX at $1 any time between now and May 20th.  \nIf IDEX goes to $100\/share, those contracts will be worth about $9900 each. Times ten and that's a lot of money. Just want to show you what your option is doing for you. Since $100\/share unlikely, let's look a bit more realistically...  \nIf IDEX goes to $1.05 by expiration, your contracts (depending on how much time you have left, so lets assume the final day, May 20th) will be worth about .05 (the difference between your strike and where it closes on that day). Congrats, you can buy 100 shares of IDEX at 1.00\/share (per contract) and they're now worth 1.05\/each. Since you paid .03 for the contract, you've made .02\/share ($2.00\/contract; $20.00\/10 contracts)  \n\n\nHowever, if IDEX ends at .99 on May 20th, your contracts will be worthless (because why buy shares at $1.00\/share when you can buy them on the open market at .99?)  \n\n\nOf course, you don't usually want to hold contracts to expiration, so you may see the value of those contracts fluctuate as the price moves (more volatility generally means contract prices will be higher).\n\nHope this helps, and good luck."}
{"question":"Reality Check - Brutal Honesty I see so much stuff on here from people who aren\u2019t profitable or just flat out talking out of their ass and I think it\u2019s necessary for someone to be honest and straight forward about Day Trading and what you should and shouldn\u2019t be doing. This is going to be brutally honest and probably hurt some feeling but it needs to be said. I\u2019ll try to keep this as simple as possible.\n\n1. Trading doesn\u2019t give out participation trophies\u2014\u2014\u2014people on here always saying it takes years and eventually you will figure it out. No. Keep trying you\u2019ll get better. No. I\u2019m still learning and it\u2019s been 5 years and I just figured it out. No\u2026. This is a serious career that requires constant focus, preparation, studying, screen time, discipline etc. if you are not going to basically devote your life to this craft it\u2019s just not going to work. I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s the reality. The Market I.E. other traders aren\u2019t going to hand you money. Not going to happen. Just you showing up isn\u2019t enough. \n\n2. No profitable trader is EVER going to give you their EXACT trading strategy\u2014\u2014 there isn\u2019t one mentor, YouTuber or whoever else out their willing or necessarily able to give their strategy. It\u2019s just the facts. No one\u2019s going to hand you money so stop looking and save your time. They may give you the generic strat they use such as supply and demand but their real strat may actually have 3 or 4 intricacies to supply and demand. \n\n3. If you lack discipline no matter what strategy you use you will never be good at trading bottom line\u2014\u2014 plain and simple if you are impulsive and can\u2019t follow your rules stop trading it\u2019s not for you. You can\u2019t win\n\n\n4. People around you are going to doubt you when you start and hate you if you succeed\u2014\u2014 this one sucks but it comes with the territory. You drive past the fork in the road that everyone takes and made your own path now you have to live with the repercussions from \u201cregular\u201d people that are not ambitious, judgmental, envious etc. If you don\u2019t want to deal with this stop trading. \n\n\n5. Don\u2019t slowly scale once you have a great strategy that you proved works\u2014\u2014 if you perfected your strategy size up quickly don\u2019t waste time working your way up. Obviously do what you can within the means of your account but still no need in wasting time. \n\n\n6. Desensitize yourself to money\u2014\u2014 as you scale stop worrying about the dollar amount and focus on being correct. The money will workout itself if you do your job. Your job is to execute your strategy.\n\n\n7. You can\u2019t moonlight and trade (you can\u2019t work another full time job and expect to be a great trader)\u2014\u2014 100% don\u2019t quit your job but give yourself extra time to learn. Don\u2019t quit your job until you can make a substantial living off of trading BUT understand being an expert trader is not going to come by it being a side job\n\n8. Most of you on here shouldn\u2019t be trading let alone trading real money\u2014\u2014 very few people on here will become successful traders so don\u2019t be afraid to be honest with yourself. This isn\u2019t for everyone. If you aren\u2019t disciplined, focused solely on trading, gamble, or lack self control quit now please before you ruin your life.\n\n9. If you gamble on anything quit trading\u2014\u2014 you can\u2019t be addicted to pills and be a pharmacist it\u2019s just not going to work. Give up trading or gambling but either way one has to go. They can\u2019t coexist\n\n\nI\u2019m going to stop here but I have more in-depth points I might  write later on. The stuff I said may sound cold and cynical but it\u2019s a reality you have to accept.","answer":"Excellent post\u2014not brutal at all, just straight facts.\n\nWhenever people around me ask me about getting into day trading, I always reply: '*don't do it'*.

Years of their life\u2014even over a decade\u2014flat out wasted. Not to mention all of the depression, false hope, self-inflicted torture, and mental anguish. I get goosebumps just writing this...\n\nThe truth is most people just aren't cut out for day trading. That's nothing to be ashamed about. The average person who attempts this does it half-assed; they will get chewed up and spat out\u2014leaving nothing behind but a disgruntled, pessimistic shell of themselves.\n\nHere's my favorite quote which sums up the harsh realities of what you listed:\n\n&gt;***'I wouldn't wish the day trading journey upon my worst enemy.'***"}

Or to just pay the minimum and star dumping cash into the market. The mortgage is at 3.6%","answer":"One of the good things about high inflation is that it eats away at the cost of debt (like your mortgage). Inflation is setting records month after month right now. You'd be a fool to pay down mortgage.\n\nedit:\n\nSince many people asked, it has to do with time value of money. Basically, if a house is $100k, you're better off paying that with $100k future dollars (which are worth less) than $100k present dollars, as long as the interest rate on the loan is lower than the inflation rate.\n\nTo put it another way:\n\nToday, $100k could buy approximately 5 toyota camrys. 30 years ago, it could have bought 10. In another 30 years, $100k will probably only be able to buy 1-3 toyota camrys.

{"question":"PinkPanda was just listed on CMC and released a new version of their app. A very solid play right now imo. PinkPanda was just listed on CMC this morning! What a well deserved accomplishment for this team and this community. I\u2019ve never been a part of a coin I believed in as much as I do PinkPanda. The team is as transparent and as active as I\u2019ve ever seen. They are always in the telegram answering questions. I\u2019ve seen some telegrams where people get banned just for asking something in the chat. Here the mods and dev team take time to answer everybody\u2019s questions. Also, the founder is doxxed and regularly jumps into the voice chat for AMA\u2019s.  \n\n\nThe roadmap is stellar. Not generic, but real forward thinking goals and plans to help meet needs in the market place. The team is planning a 5x leveraged mobile DEX.

I know, *everyone* says they\u2019re depressed these days. I get it. I\u2019ve been taking meds and trying every form of treatment since 1988.

{"question":"Planning for retirement considering my husband and I have a 17 year age difference My husband is 17 years older than I am and halfway through his career. I\u2019m 26 and just starting out. Right now he is the only one working and supporting the family and I\u2019m staying home with baby. \n\nOur long term plan is for me to stay home for a few more years and go back to work when baby goes to school, in about five years. Husband plans on retiring in 15-20 years while I continue working for 10 more years after that.\n\nSo in planning what we need for retirement, should we look at it as separate retirements? Or do we continue to contribute until we are both done working and live on my income until I retire? Does it make sense to contribute to our separate IRA\u2019s or should we have a joint one? And ideally we max both of them out but should we contribute to them equally or should we max his out first half of the year and then work on mine? Should we plan on touching that money during his retirement or holding off as long as we can?","answer":"There isn't enough information here to answer your questions, but I can tell you what you need to find out. \n\nFirst thing you need to figure out is if he has a workplace retirement plan, like a 401K or 403B. That in combination with your joint income will determine whether it is possible to make deductible IRA contributions. \n\nThe next thing you need to look at is term life insurance on both you and your husband. Insurance on him is priority, and it should run at least until the baby is 18, or he is retired. That means a 20 year term policy. It should have a high enough face value to offset his income should he pass away earlier than expected. Probably at least 60% of his income over the next 10 years. A ballpark figure would be if he makes $100,000, then a $600,000 20 year term would be appropriate. The insurance on you must be enough to cover childcare and lost income over the next decade should you pass away. \n\nYou need to determine if you have an ante-nuptual agreement, and if he has any prior marriages. If both of those are false, you will benefit from having a single retirement plan. This is because beneficiaries on retirement accounts generally default to the surviving spouse unless he receives spousal consent to change them. A prior marriage can mess that up, or he can have obligations outstanding on his retirement accounts per his divorce decree. This gets a lot more complex, so if there are any prior marriages, see a professional. \n\nYou should max any workplace retirement for him first, then eliminate any high interest detb second, then max any IRA for each of you that is tax deferred third. If you do all that accelerate paying off any mortgage.or low interest debt you carry. \n\nYou two also need to get your wills in order if they are not currently, although your husbands is more urgent. \n\nI believe you both would benefit pretty massively from seeing a financial planner. They will probably have relatively similar core recommendations to what I provided here (workplace retirement, IRAs. Wills, Term Insurance), backed by a lot more information, and they will help you execute on it. \n\nThey will also be able to map out a cash flow timeline for you two so that you can be confident and comfortable that regardless of when each of you passes your spouse and child are cared for, and you will both be able to live out retirement with minimal financial stress."}

{"question":"Insecure about the size of your volume? Don't worry, it looks even weirder than you think!  \n\nHello fellow Apes! This is my first attempt at some DD, and is in essence more just me sharing my findings in the hope that a more wrinkled brain than mine can make some sense of it. As usual, this is not financial advice, this is just data I have observed from Yahoo finance - and anyone can go and check this for themselves if they want. **Warning: lots of numbers, not any pictures, I apologise.**\n\n**Preface: Hello everyone, if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll likely be worrying that your volume is too small. You\u2019ll be sitting up at night wishing to God to make your volume a little bit bigger so you can satisfy your wife\u2019s boyfriend as much as he deserves. Well I am here to tell you that your volume looks even weirder than it is small!**\n\n***TA:DR at the end***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 1: We are very special and unique and that\u2019s okay**\n\nWhile watching the daily volume chart throughout today, I was struck by how many minutes we experienced less than 1000 volume. More than 10 separate minutes today traded with volumes in the hundreds, and yet we closed out with a similar volume to the last 2 days, a little higher in fact. This got me wondering \u201cthere must be some real girthy crayons to average this out\u201d, so I sat down to look at today\u2019s chart. I instantly spotted that throughout the day, there were around 15 big, thicc green and red crayons scattered amongst the other pathetic wimpy green and red crayons. I quickly realised that each of these markers actually represented more than 1% of the entire day\u2019s volume, being traded in just 1 minute. For reference, there are 390 minutes in the trading day, so each should have an **average**  of 0.256% of the day\u2019s volume. \n\nOn a hunch, I checked some boomer stocks and the sibling stock who-must-not-be-named, and I found I was correct - there are **far more 1%+ candles per day in GME than in those other stocks.**\n\nSo I decided to work out the numbers properly, and post my first DD. Hopefully someone out there can work out why this is happening, and maybe the frequency of these big candles can be used to work out why large volumes are trading at certain times.\n\nTo determine which candles to focus on, I decided to concentrate on candles representing more than 1% of the daily volume, and also 20% under that 1% value as - without looking a little below 1%, there just was not enough data from any of the stocks I looked at - other than GME.\n\nSo for this DD, I will be referring to these candles as **Significant ticks,** dividing them as such:\n\n**Candles with volume &gt;1% of total daily volume will be referred to as \u201cMajorly Significant Ticks\u201d**\n\nAnd\n\n**Candles with volume between 0.8% and 1% of total daily volume will be referred to as \u201cMinorly Significant Ticks\u201d.**\n\nSo, as I mentioned previously, boomer stocks have VERY few Majorly Significant ticks during the day. I started looking deeper and found that for these stocks, those big boi candles almost only ever happen within 10 minutes of market open\/close. I checked the fruit stock and that other large tech one that isn\u2019t big or hard - and found that per day, they have an average this week of 0-2 Significant Ticks outwith 10 minutes of market open and close. So, between 9:40 and 15:49, only around 0-2 of their 370 minutes have significant volume.\n\nThe movie stock has an average this week of 8 Significant Ticks per day,\n\nWe, my dear apes, have this week an **average of 19.75 Significant Ticks per day.**\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the main difference between us and them is how many of our Ticks **occur outwith 10 minutes of market open and close.** Even with the movie stock, their significant ticks during the middle of the day is at an average of 5, so 37.5% of their significant ticks happen in the first or last 10 minutes of the market being open. I am delighted to inform you that we have an average of **13.75** significant ticks between 9:40 and 15:49. I\u2019m sure even the smoothest-brained apes out there can see that 13.75 is bigger than both the movie stock's 5, and the boomer stocks' 0-2.\n\n**Part 2: So just how much volume is in these fat, juicy candles**\n\nHere is where we, unfortunately, get to the numbers part. I have spent the last 3 hours going minute by minute through the last 4 days of GME\u2019s trading to get these statistics, so you\u2019d all better be grateful or I\u2019m telling RC on you.\n\nIf anyone wants the raw data I have put together to look at themselves, or to turn into fancy graphs and charts for visual learners (I\u2019m not skilled enough in IT, nor do I care enough at 2am to give it a shot myself) then please DM me and I\u2019ll happily send you screenshots: warning, it\u2019s an absolute mess that likely only makes sense to my autistic brain, but you\u2019re welcome to look.\n\nI have only collected data from the 4 days this week, I plan to do the same again tomorrow and post an update.

I did hold SPLV for a bit, but after a bit of research, I realized how much it has underperformed the broad market even with dividends. I sold it off and bought AAPL and VTI.

{"question":"Taxes and fat FIRE My wife and I are at a point where we're able to fire and cover our expenses with a 4% withdrawal rate. But is there something I'm missing around taxes?\n\nIt seems like our community emphasizes the 4% number, but that doesn't take tax related expenses into account. For example, we have some long term capital gains that we're going to need to pay on our next egg, so shouldn't we be budgeting more like ~8%?  \n\nFor context, we're in the top federal bracket and have to deal with CA's high state taxes.  We also plan to withdraw $350k per year to cover our HCOL expenses. \n\nWanted to put this out here to see how other folks are the thinking about taxes and how that impacts their fire numbers. ","answer":"You are correct that 4% is a common pre-tax number \\[1\\] and that taxes can create a high drag when you start realizing a lot of gains. \/r\/financialindependence doesn't worry so much about taxes as most people there are probably paying &lt; 5% effective in taxes during retirement. (e.g. a $100k drawdown\/year).  In CA, the highest bracket for long term is 37%, so while a 2x buffer is a bit excessive, taxes are a concern.\n\nLet's work out the details under simple, extremely conservative assumptions (everything is VTSAX in taxable with a 0 basis)\n\n* 0.6% annual returns tax hit from dividend taxation (so drop your \"withdrawal\" rate by this amount).\n* \\~$425,000 gains needed to support $350k post-tax (18% tax cost).\n* Overall, this puts your safe withdrawal (post-tax) at something like 2.8% (equivalent to a \"budget\" of \\~5.7%).  \n\nBut you should do the math yourself.  There's less issue the more assets you have in tax-advantaged accounts or if your basis is higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\]  Note that it isn't necessarily a safe number for super early retirement (it's the safe number for 30 years) - 3.5% is more along the lines of \"safe\" longer-term - but I'll use 4% for the sake of this argument."}
{"question":"Guide for Noobs April 2021 Edition For those who are new to investing in crypto - do know that we are on the meme phase cycle. Almost 99% of the tokens that you see coming out are all memes - some on DxSale, some \"fair launches\" \\*laughs\\* , and some just straight up long cons. Most of the real companies like DxSale, PancakeSwap, QuickSwap etc., have had their run of ICO's themselves during 2020 summer. You are late to the party and missed the big real company presale runs. However, fear not - more will come in 2021 summer or after a small cryptocurrency crash. The following is a quick research guide I made for beginners who are crying because of the dumps and scams. Believe me, this is not new to crypto, we have seen this back in 2017 as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Research guide for idiots for any presale regardless of DxSale or Not:**\n\n* Team token % - if its way too high , expect a dump.\n* Doxxing - If theyre not doxxed , expect a dump (not all anon teams are bad i.e DxSale themselves)\n* Road map - If the road map is just tiktok marketing, NFT, charity, that aint real road map. The road map for charity should be partnering with charity foundations, thats a real roadmap. Proof of donation, thats a real charity road map. Tiktok marketing, and NFT are fake hypes.\n* Token Contract:\n   * Minting function - not all minting function is bad, depending on the reason of the mint. Could be for farming but you have to really know if that is what it is for.\n   * Transaction fee - If the transaction fee is changeable on the fly, they can change the transaction fee to 100% and just pause you from taking money out while they dump and take money out from Pancakeswap regardless of liquidity lock on DxSale. Thats not Pancakeswap or DxSale's fault, thats your fault for not knowing transaction fee is changeable on their custom token contract.\n   * Ownership - If the token contract ownership is not burned, that can be dangerous depending on the contract.\n   * Liquidity Pool transaction fee to wallet - If the owner is receiving the liquidity pool fees from the Pancakeswap trades, know that it can be used maliciously. They can pull the money out. Now - safemoon contract (which is now copied by 99% of the tokens) can do that 100% , you have been warned.\n   * Ctrl+F searching for function name is not effective, they can hide a \"minting function\" under let's say \"math function\", advanced scammers know this. 99% of scammers are noob scammers who are asking for help from real developers in the various telegram chats. They won't scam with fake functions.\n* Utility\/dApp - I see alot of coins now show a demo of the utility. When you go on their website you easily see that their dApp doesn't actually work. Few of these companies use this as a long con to get the most money possible.\n* Do not Fomo into this hype - most hypes are by the people who fomo'd in before you.\n* If you are using DxSale, make sure you look at the presale metrics of the presale you are interested in. Make sure you click the token contract on top of the page and read it. Read it because your investment depends on it. If it's a launch in 2 minutes and you have no time to read it, do not put your money in because then you will come back in this reddit post and complain anyway.","answer":"Made a lot of money in DxSale recently. What I can say:\n\nNever put money in a token with a muted Telegram. NEVER. Unless its a temporary mute for some reason. \"Enabling chat after listing\" = scam.\n\nIf theres no mods in the TG, dont put money in the token. Theres a group of fudders right now and they will fucking kill your token before you can make money.\n\nIf the TG have 1k members but theres no one talking or the presale is not filling up fucking quick its probably a scam. A real TG with 1k members will fill a presale in seconds even with a 300 BNB hard cap. Even 200 members will fill up a presale in seconds.\n\nA lot of people are shilling their bag. I almost never buy token if its not a presale, and if I buy them its because theres a huge dip or I love the project. Never buy a big dump on a dogshit coin, its probably dead at this point and theyre trying to shill their bag to dump with a profit.\n\nTheres nothing wrong with coins like PenisElon or Elon100x but take it as a gamble and put money you can lose, these communities can be funny at late night trying to pump the coin up, but dont take that as an investment, its not better than playing on Bustabit or something like that. Dont invest in a coin with a name like \"PenisElon\" like its a NASDAQ stock, its gambling.\n\nRight now on DxSales the meta is fair launches. People taking part on a presale dont have a bonus at the listing, but they are sure they can have the token at the lowest cost possible (if it doesnt dump). If the \"PancakeSwap Listing Rate\" is the same as \"Presale Rate\" and theres a lot of hype around the coin you can hop in the presale, it can be a good coin.  \n\n\nMaking money on DxSales is hard as fuck since a couple days, whales dont fuck with their BNB because its pumping and they dont want to lose them. Find the gem in the ocean of dogshit."}

{"question":"If you entered in 2021, your exit strategy should be in Q3-2025, not in 2022. Aim for the next halving. This is in reference to the stock-to-flow model, which I believe is a solid indication on BTC's path albeit taking a different route right now. The stock-to-flow model suggests that should be roaming in the region of USD 100k during this period, but we have not even seen it going passed USD 70k yet.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wny63lj62ry81.png?width=1789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8222f0ca93d62aa793f7d5a2164437c0e2ff619\n\nThat being said, there is a glaring change of pattern between the previous bear market, against the current bear market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Year|2013 - 2015|2018-2020|2022-2024 (?)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Peak Price|USD 1,149.14|USD 19,970|USD 69,050|\n|Bear Market Low|USD 197.24|USD 3,109|USD 28,000-29,000 (?)|\n|Drawdown|\\-83%|\\-84%|\\-58% (For now)|\n\nRealistically, BTC does not go lower than its previous ATH, according to previous patterns. So, we probably won't see BTC going down below USD 19,970. This is why this current bear market is interesting. We are seeing possibly a **lowering in the drawdown**.\n\nThe bear market is getting more and more bearable. Pun intended.\n\nThat being said, if you had entered into crypto this year, then the next point of exit should be by the next halving in 2024\/2025. Although the current halving hasn't met the expectations yet, the previous halving would suggest that the metrics is rather promising. If you're concerned about the stock-to-flow model not meeting the prediction this time, consider that BTC had exceeded the stock-to-flow prices previously as well. It will eventually balances out.\n\nHowever, you do need to pay additional considerations if you're jumping into alts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I have just found out through the comments that the S2F model is invalidated. I stand corrected, and appreciate the comments.\n\nMy key takeaway is chiming through Plan B's note as well-\n\n1.

BTC have not went below it's previous 'ATH', in this case, it's around USD 19k.\n\nI am however still adamant that you should go through at least 1 full cycle of BTC halving for your exit strategy. This isn't a get-rich scheme, and the cycle is rather inevitable IMO. It's just that now, we are seeing a different ratio to the cycle.","answer":"I don't believe bitcoin halving predictions anymore.

This sub seems to ground me back to reality - seeing people succeed not by YOLOing into risky options trades, or betting their retirement funds on a handful of meme stocks - but rather just playing the percentages game, and letting compound interest do all the work. \n\nHowever, one thing that I\u2019ve noticed developing over the last year or so is this feeling of borderline elitism that some members give off when discussing high yield buy-write funds like JEPI\/JEPQ, ETV, CII, etc. \u201cThey\u2019re capping your gains by selling covered calls!\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t put any higher allocation into these funds than you would into a single position!\u201d or variations thereof are frequent narratives against buying them\u2026 And for the life of me, I can\u2019t figure out why.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re capping your gains to achieve higher yields!\u201d Okay? So? That\u2019s\u2026 the entire reason I\u2019m holding them. My goal is to seek income from securities, and *that\u2019s the* *point* of these funds. I want income, so I bought an income fund. If I wanted growth, I\u2019d buy a growth fund. For some of these, you get a bit of both, which is the main reason I would buy a fund like JEPQ or ETW as opposed to a safer bond fund like BND, or a riskier growth fund like TQQQ. Ironically, the same argument against buying a buy\/write fund could also be made against holding strong dividend companies like O, T, F, etc (which are held by a lot of these funds anyways, but we\u2019ll get to that later). It\u2019s not usually until after companies mature and slow their growth that they finally start paying higher dividends, if any. It\u2019s why Alphabet doesn\u2019t pay a dividend, and arguably why Apple doesn\u2019t pay a higher one. So if your goal is to seek dividends, *seek dividends.* You\u2019ll make more in *dividends* with 100k of ETB than you would with the same investment in VOOV, with roughly the same beta; which leads me to my next pet peeve. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put any more than x percentage into any one of these funds. You have to diversify with individual holdings, too.\u201d I can understand the rationale behind this, I really can; business risk is a real thing, and these funds aren\u2019t guaranteed to exist forever. That being said, these funds are also far better diversified than most of us will ever be, and they\u2019re managed by people who have been doing this professionally for years. They have access to better information, tools, and connections than you or I ever will. Does that mean they\u2019re immune to being mismanaged? Absolutely not. But it does help shift the responsibility of analyzing earnings reports to the funds, not myself. So take a dive into the funds, and reward the ones that do their homework with your money, just as you would with any other company. And if you still really feel like it, you can \u201cdiversify\u201d into NASDAQ based funds all you want by buying JEPQ, QYLD, and CII at the same time, but all that ends up happening is you end up buying the same MSFT and NVDA shares, just under a different name. Again, totally your call if you\u2019re that concerned about the fund going bankrupt, but it\u2019s likely overly cautious. After all, I have a strong feeling that JP Morgan or Blackrock will be around for much longer than anyone here will be.\n\nAnyways, rant over. If you\u2019ve done your homework, and want to purchase shares of a buy\/write fund, don\u2019t let some smug internet stranger make you feel like an idiot for buying them. I personally throw as much as I can afford into a ROTH IRA containing JEPQ (for NASDAQ exposure), JEPI (S&amp;P 500 exposure), ETW (global exposure), ETV (predictable dividends, with a secondary goal of growth), and a small position in UWMC that I immensely regret buying at $5 a share (but try to assuage my brain by calling that one a LoNg TerM pLaY). I have DRIP turned on for all of them, and I plan on simply turning DRIP off someday and enjoying the income to pad my measly 401k and Social Security, if it still exists by then.","answer":"I agree.

{"question":"Up 65.2% on my account since January 1st -- finally found a trading style that works for me in the Futures market. Thought I'd share. Here's a screenshot of my trading results since January 1st of this year to today (August 25th) from my Tradovate account:  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$19,561.59 Net Profit, Started With $30,000](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/97i650t3orj91.png?width=444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74e81318f7fc79c48efe8fc6d8292bfe76d407d2)\n\nI started getting interested in trading back in 2018 and I worked REALLY hard trying to learn it. I tried all sorts of trading styles and instruments. Stocks, options, forex, futures. I tried all the indicators and styles. Tried day trading and swing trading and all of that. \n\nI lost a TON of money. I don't know how much exactly, but I'd estimate I lost about $60,000 in \"market tuition\" trying to learn how to trade.\n\nThis year in 2022 has been my first consistently good year. I started with $30,000 and I'm up to $49,561 representing an over 65% gain on my account. \n\nAnd the style \/ strategy that finally got me to a level of comfort and reliability in my trading has been **seasonality** and **spread trading** in the futures market. \n\nAbout a year and a half ago I came across a book totally by chance on Kindle called *\"Commodity Spread Trading -- Take Advantage of Seasonality: Volume 1\"* by David Carli.\n\nIn the book he mentioned a series of resources that I'd never heard of before. \n\n* MRCI (dot com)\n* SeasonAlgo (dot com)\n* Spreadcharts (dot com) &lt;&lt; I use mainly the other two and rarely use this one\n\nAnd he showed how to analyze seasonality and also how to analyze spread trades on commodities. \n\nSo let me show you some examples of how this works.   \n\n\n**SEASONALITY ON OUTRIGHT FUTURES (NOT A SPREAD)**\n\nThe first thing I do is check MRCI every day. When you go to this website it looks like it was built it in 1997. It's super cheap (like $40ish a month or something) and as far as I can tell they do ZERO marketing. \n\nBut apparently they're like the go-to resource for seasonality traders. And I can see why because it's the best resource I've ever found for this stuff. \n\nSo when you get on there, you'll see a list like this for the current month and the following month:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0pl5s2keqrj91.png?width=129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db66ae5622de99dc61bf9e1d167527dca6789a44\n\nFor outright futures (meaning not a spread) you would click \"Seasonal Trades.\"\n\nWhen you do you'll be presented with a list like the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8ie6liumqrj91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4545215e8e098186fb1ab83bceae48b588f24160\n\nSo what you're looking at is the signal on the left hand side like \"Buy December Gold GCZ2). Then you see an entry date (8\/11) and an exit date (9\/1). And a win % (87%) and some more stats. \n\nWhat this is basically saying is that -- over the last 15 years -- if you had bought December Gold futures between the dates of 8\/11 and 9\/1 you would have profited 87% of the time with an average $2,720 profit (per contract). \n\n**I use this to find high probability trades, but I always do another layer of basic technical analysis to see which trades I want to get into.** \n\nSo for example I DID NOT take that gold trade for the following reason...  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Gold Was \\\\\"Over Bought\\\\\" on MACD so I did not buy](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yvl0478grrj91.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6323493593111bc14c8fbe1ccd846886ccd05747)\n\nWhen I see a buy signal, I go and check the chart. And IDEALLY I want to see that the MACD is actually over-sold on a 1 day and also over-sold on a 4 hour basis. \n\nWhen I checked gold, I saw that the MACD was actually over-bought and changing momentum to the down-side so I did not do that trade.\n\nThis basic, simple rule either qualifies the trade or disqualifies the trade for me. If it's a short-signal, then I'd want to see the inverse (over-bought). \n\n**But recently Crude Oil qualified for me.**\n\nMRCI recommended to buy May 2023 Crude Oil between August 16th and August 29th.\n\nHere's the 15 year track record of that trade:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vdarlxc5srj91.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbd77456538d0dea6fc0cf37a616c0e70333864d\n\nI went and checked the chart and it lined up with my very basic rule for these trades -- MACD was over-sold and Crude Oil seemed to be sitting at a level of support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/big3m3lesrj91.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fb3b79608cf305826137c57719334a6e31d4704\n\nI bought 1 contract and recently sold it for **+$3,360 profit.** I sold it before the seasonal trade window was finished and I could have made more, because it's gone up even more since then, but I thought the big immediate push up was great and wanted to book profit. \n\n*So that's how I trade the OUTRIGHT futures -- but I also do spread trading.*\n\n**SEASONALITY ON FUTURES SPREADS**\n\nSo also on MRCI you have \"Seasonal Spreads\" -- \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xf7a1vmzsrj91.png?width=118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d936e29c245817792708da90a32038a08a99e1b9\n\nAnd when you click on it it's a similar setup as the outrights -- it shows you a table like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zsx19ka5trj91.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8244152be045bf69e93c5801d107eb89ce70d00b\n\nSpread trading is where you basically simultaneously BUY one contract and SHORT another at the same time. \n\nAnd rather than betting \"directionally\" you're actually moreover betting on a mean reversion. \n\nSo I qualify which trade to take based on a different approach, but it's also pretty simple. \n\nSo take #5576 for example -- Buy July 2023 Lean Hogs and Sell February 2023 Lean Hogs.\n\nThis is usually where I go over to SeasonAlgo and build out that chart. \n\nHere's what it looks like....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rqo5ddmttrj91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83743a48e9adeb549b2f9e319930f6e0ac246d3a\n\nYou see on the top left there I've inputted the contracts (HEN23-HEG23) and the time frame \"Enter on 8\/08 and exit on 11\/12) and it's a \"buy\" meaning I am BUYING the HEN23 contract and SELLING the HEG23 contract. \n\nIf I flipped the order of those contracts around, it would be the exact same trade, I'd just be \"selling\" the spread. \n\nSimilar to how BUYING EUR\/USD is the same as SHORTING USD\/EUR. It's the same trade. \n\nIt builds out the chart for me as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5ivy7gmaurj91.png?width=1863&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb9b0cea37821d066eafb490359bd39ec10e7dcf\n\nThe black line is the current contract spread. The red line is that same spread over the last 5 years. The blue line is that same spread over the last 15 years. \n\nThe horizontal green line is the entry and the horizontal red line is the exit. \n\nThe first thing I look for is -- is the current spread AT or BELOW the 5 year and 15 year historical spreads?\n\nIn this case you can see that the black line started out considerably lower in price than the 5 and 15 year average. \n\nI like that -- it means historically I'm getting the spread for cheap. And as you can see the spread moved way up right after I bought it. \n\nThe next thing I like to look at is \"Continuation\" and I'll show you what that looks like...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/eoxmtylxurj91.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12d1346d860e46d994e9cf9cfbdb5b323c9658cf\n\nHere is this spread over the last 30 years. You can see that \n\nAnd this is what these spreads do (any spread) the just go UP and DOWN in fixed ranges and that's it. That's how they act. \n\nSO -- **I would NOT take this trade if the spread was in the middle or TOP of that range I've highlighted there.** \n\n**BUT -- because the spread is at the lower end of that range (since 2015) I did initiate the trade.**\n\nSo far this spread is up **+$1,140**. \n\nAnd the great thing about futures spreads is that most brokers automatically recognize them as LESS risky. So they will REDUCE your margin requirements by up to 80%. So you can do these trades with less money than it takes to do the outright futures spreads, which usually require higher margin rates. \n\n**Okay! Hope you guys liked that. I enjoy sharing what's working for me and this seasonal trading strategy on futures has worked remarkably well.**","answer":"This is really cool I will have to read it a few times and re check all the acronyms etc .

{"question":"Inflation will remain elevated for a few more years **TLDR**: Companies will keep investing in redundant, diversified supply chains. Countries will force more localization due to national security risks. Energy prices will remain high. China will stick to its zero-covid policy. Rising rates will reduce demand and make credit more expensive. Reduced demand will hurt the economies of scale. Expensive credit will make ongoing investments more expensive to complete. Prices will keep going up for a few years, until these factors are mitigated. The market bottom will be when the companies cancel stock buybacks and start printing shares.\n\n# Long read\n\nThe prevailing narrative today is that central banks will keep raising interest rates and sucking money out of the economy by other means, which will tame inflation sometime soon in 2023 due to reduced demand and economic slowdown. This is what the financial markets are pricing in, judging by bets on rates and bonds.\n\nHowever, the global inflation we are experiencing today is not driven purely by monetary policies. That\u2019s why inflation is global, spanning the whole world, even though different countries have vastly different monetary policies.\n\nThere are pockets of inflation, which are global, and were caused by relentless money printers, like real estate, travel, luxury goods, crypto, and various other assets. This is where the largest price reductions will continue. If you have any type of asset, it\u2019s safe to say it will depreciate even more. Declines in housing and rent will drive down inflation metrics across the world, helping the central banks get closer to their inflation targets.\n\nBut the central banks cannot meet their 2% goals, because they cannot mitigate other factors causing global inflation. These are supply chain issues, caused first by COVID-19, then strict China zero-covid policies, then Russian invasion of Ukraine. We have an energy and food crises on top of that, also caused by the war in Ukraine. There\u2019s nothing central banks can do about restructuring of supply chains, food scarcity, and energy shortage. They won\u2019t be able to meet their inflation targets anytime soon and will have to keep higher rates in place for a few years.\n\n# Just-in-time vs Redundancy\n\nUp until COVID-19, just-in-time production was *the way* of manufacturing. Whoever was more efficient at doing this was winning the profits race. The approach first pioneered by Toyota eventually was applied across the global economy. Until the priorities changed.\n\nFirst, the pandemic exacerbated problems of this model. Companies suddenly became unable to get the parts needed anymore and were dependent on various government policies regulating lockdowns. Production of everything, from bicycles to cars, was disrupted, often delayed by a single missing part. For example, Ford currently delays production of its most lucrative F-150 trucks, because its single supplier of company badges and logos is in trouble.\n\n[Ford\u2019s Latest Supply-Chain Problem: a Shortage of Blue Oval Badges](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/fords-latest-supply-chain-snarl-not-enough-blue-oval-badges-11663944141)\n\nSecond, there was a strong belief that global trade and mutual benefits would prevent countries from starting large scale conflicts, because it would devastate the quality of life of everyone involved and beyond. This belief was shattered after Russia started a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the governments across the world are scared, and want to mitigate their national security risks. This includes everything, from food, to energy, to semiconductors, to commodities, etc.\n\nCombined, this led to manufacturing being restructured from just-in-time into a redundancy model. Companies want to secure their own exclusive supply chains and have back-up options. Countries want to have localized manufacturing of various goods to mitigate national security risks.\n\nThe pandemic and the war are not the only factors they fear. Whether it\u2019s an earthquake in Taiwan or a blockade from China, it\u2019s the same risk to have all your chips manufactured there. The risks were always present but became much more prominent in a short period of time.\n\nComing back to Ford, and car manufacturers in general. They will have to source materials and produce the batteries locally to qualify for EV subsidies. This is a massive undertaking, which requires to build new mines, factories and duplicate numerous other elements of EV supply chain.\n\nRestructuring of supply chains is a very expensive process on its own. This will keep driving prices higher over the next few years, until we see the first benefits coming to fruition. The prices won\u2019t go down after that either because redundancy is more expensive. Combined with higher cost for local wages, more expensive locally sourced materials, higher environmental standards, etc., this will stick prices to a higher level. We are years away from reaching those levels.\n\n# Micron case\n\nLet\u2019s have a detailed look at a specific company to highlight the trend. Micron is not unique in what it\u2019s doing, but perfectly illustrates what the companies around the world are going through.\n\nMicron is a great company. It has valuable, high margin, industry leading products. It has been around forever and will outlive all of you reading this text.\n\nHowever, its stock is down roughly 50% and may as well lose another 50% until we reach the bottom. Why is that?\n\nFirst, they need to invest a lot in local manufacturing in the US. They do not have an option of not doing this. And we are talking about $150 billion over the next decade.\n\n[Micron to spend up to $100 billion to build a computer chip factory in New York](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/10\/04\/micron-to-spend-up-to-100-billion-to-build-new-york-chip-plant.html)\n\n[Micron breaks ground on $15 billion U.S. chip plant, says more to come soon](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/micron-breaks-ground-15-bln-us-chip-plant-says-more-come-soon-2022-09-12\/)\n\n[Micron Announces Over $150 Billion in Global Manufacturing and R&amp;D Investments](https:\/\/investors.micron.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/micron-announces-over-150-billion-global-manufacturing-and-rd)\n\nThe company also must diversify its supply chains. For example, Ukraine used to supply 70% of neon gases used in semiconductors manufacturing. Micron is adding redundancies to avoid bottlenecks like this one in the future.\n\n[Micron has diversified sourcing for its noble gases](https:\/\/evertiq.com\/design\/51415)\n\nIt will take years for Micron to see the first benefits of these investments. And many more years for these investments to pay off. At the same time, the PC market is going through the worst slowdown in 20 years, while their current supply chains are still damaged by the war and zero-covid policies in China.\n\n[PC Shipments Plunge Nearly 20%, Steepest Drop in More Than 20 Years](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/pc-shipments-plunge-nearly-20-steepest-drop-in-more-than-20-years-11665442764)\n\nHow would Micron pay for these investments? Micron does not have $150 billion to invest and will have to find a way to finance this endeavor. It cannot avoid or postpone the investments and would have to drive them to completion no matter the cost.\n\nThis is a weird situation, where the central banks are trying their best to reduce inflation, but making mandatory investments like these more expensive, which will drive prices higher, and keep inflation elevated. A conundrum, which is mostly ignored today.\n\nMicron, as well as other global companies, would go through a path, which would force them to raise prices for their products, but still end up indebted, strapped for cash, going through periods of unprofitability, and having their stocks at depressed valuations.\n\n# Buy High, Sell Low\n\nUnfortunately, companies typically purchase a record amount of their stock at peak valuations when they have record profits. Last year the top companies spent their entire yearly profits on stock buybacks (Microsoft, Meta, Google, Nvidia, etc.). They bought the all-time high number of shares at the all-time high prices.\n\nFor example, last year Meta spent **$44.8 billion** on buybacks, which is roughly its yearly profit. And Meta spent almost $19 billion on buybacks in the last three months 2021 alone, at the top of the top of its stock price. What this means, is the company made no money last year. They spent all of their profits on buybacks, but the stock fell by 60% anyway.\n\n[Meta Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Results](https:\/\/investor.fb.com\/investor-news\/press-release-details\/2022\/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Results\/default.aspx)\n\nCompanies are reluctant to cancel buybacks because this would immediately tank their shares. Instead, they try to reduce costs, freeze hiring, do layoffs, issue debt, postpone investments, and when everything else is off the table, they finally cancel buybacks. And only after that do they reduce dividends.\n\nCost reduction, freeze hiring, small layoffs, and debt issuance are already ongoing across the US economy and increasing by the day. Investments, which would typically be postponed in this situation, are increasing, and financed through debt. Let's look at Meta again. Even though this company is not affected by supply chain issues, it's also in the process of going through the largest restructuring in its history and betting its future on it. This trend seems to be universal and encompassing even unrelated companies, probably due to record profits last year.\n\n[Meta raises $10 billion in first-ever bond offering](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/meta-raises-10-billion-first-ever-bond-offering-2022-08-09\/)\n\nThe interest rates are rapidly rising, and it will soon become too expensive to issue more debt. The companies will then tap more into their cash reserves and future profits. At some point, this won\u2019t be enough to cover the expenses and buybacks would have to go. This would crash their already depressed stocks. Then companies would have to go through a period of unprofitability and finance their needs through issuing shares at the very bottom of the market.\n\nIt's typical for companies to issue shares at the bottom of the market when they have no other options. For example, they almost unanimously printed shares during the bottom of 2020 pandemic crash. And next time, when stocks are at their most depressed levels, when companies are hammered in the news about their poor financial choices, and start printing shares again to stay afloat, would be a good time to buy in. This would be the bottom of the bottom.\n\nWhether it's Micron, or Meta, or pretty much any other large public company, they all are going through a similar path. The next few years are going to be rough.\n\n# Expensive Transition\n\nThis transition could have been easier if China or Russia did not change their constitutions to appease their leaders. But both of them did everything to let their leaders stay in power for life.\n\nChina is going to stick to its most damaging policies, because their supreme leader is not allowed to admit mistakes. Whatever choices were made must be the right ones. This means zero-covid policies and frequent lockdowns of hundreds of millions of people will continue. This will keep randomly damaging supply chains of any product imaginable, spiking prices and causing shortages, until redundancies are in place.\n\nSimilarly, the supreme leader of Russia can not admit his mistakes and would have to wage the war until the bitter end. Losing the war is the end for him and his inner circle. This will exclude Russia from the global economy for the foreseeable future and continue the energy and food crises.\n\nThe central banks will continue their fight against inflation. They know they messed up by printing too much money and inflating every asset price imaginable. They want to restore their credibility and cannot back down from this path, because otherwise there\u2019s a risk of hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is much worse than a recession. But because inflation is partly caused by non-monetary factors, the central banks would make ongoing changes in the economy more expensive and inadvertently force inflation to remain higher than their typical 2% targets.\n\nIf the central banks had not printed as much money as they did over the last decade, and kept their interest rates reasonably higher, this would be the perfect time for them to reduce the rates and help companies finance their massive investments. Instead, the central banks will make this process more expensive, which will result in higher prices, and will make it harder to bring inflation below 2%.\n\nThe central banks will be able to reduce demand. However, reduced demand won\u2019t always make prices cheaper either, because it will decrease the benefits of the economies of scale.\n\nConsider an industry like travel. If fewer and fewer people can afford to travel, and energy prices remain high due to a shortage, then reduced demand only makes flying more expensive. If there\u2019s not enough people to occupy all the seats in an airplane, then each ticket becomes more expensive. The economies of scale benefit from high utilization, once demand goes down, profitability is reduced everywhere, from cloud services to food delivery.","answer":"CPI has been nearly flat since June. The inflation numbers that everyone has been fixated on is a comparison of CPI today vs. CPI 12 months ago. In Sept 2022, CPI was 296.808. This is a 8.2% year-over-year increase (Sept 2021 CPI was 274.310) but only a 0.2% increase compared to the CPI one month prior (Aug 2022 CPI was 296.171). If you annualized the monthly growth rate between Aug 2022 and Sep 2022, you get 2.6% annual inflation. If CPI stays on this monthly growth rate, the annual inflation numbers will be back in this 2.X% ballpark once we complete a full lap around the sun. \n\nInterest rates may stay high, but if prices stay where they are, inflation will be low next year.\n\nSource: https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/regions\/mid-atlantic\/data\/consumerpriceindexhistorical_us_table.htm\n\nEdited to include link to CPI data."}

How do I find a legit property management company \/ full service firm, and how much should I expect to pay or receive?","answer":"Why does the money partner need to split it?  It's probably easier to just hire and pay a property management company and handyman.  \n\nProp management typically charges a flat rate a month depending on the type of property.

We're now seeing huge buying giving EOS the 'ethereum killer' the spotlight all while Devcon3 quietly goes on in the background.

{"question":"Small Account Challenge - Week 2 Day 1 - 20% gain - Half of Weekly Target in One Day!!! Hey all,\n\nWelcome to the 5th day of the $1k to $10k Challenge, where I daytrade my way to $10k.\n\nA few notes before the update:\n\n1. I'm using a cash account to avoid PDT\n2. I mostly daytrade 0DTE QQQ options, but not opposed to any opportunity that comes up\n3. I use Support\/Resistances, VWAP, 50\/200 MA, and RSI to daytrade.\n4. I use the 1 minute chart\n\n**Challenge Overview**\n\nWow! What an amazing start to the week, 20% gain, that's half of the 40% weekly target! This is great and not because that means we can make more money this week, quite the opposite it means we can now afford more red days and still hit our weekly target. That means we can afford tighter stops and can trade in a much more relaxed state of mind. With that said let's see how we got there today and what I could have done better because believe it or not we could have 3x the gains, in hindsight.\n\nAlso another great thing today, as you guys requested the buys were alerted in the discord before I bought them so you can play along with me. Consider joining if you haven't we have a great little community and it's free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/projdjwf23x81.jpg?width=473&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c121ed2d97b7dcb859cdb47698bbdc1e6a2461e\n\n**What did I trade?**\n\nToday we had 2 trades\n\n1. QQQ 313P 0DTE - 2 Contracts - $2.5 Average - Sold at $3\n2. QQQ 310P 0DTE - 6 contracts - $1.46 Average - Sold at $1.75\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m7cgp8hg23x81.jpg?width=472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fd0dad6785836c925d46ee1e67de870da194272\n\n**Why did I pick these trades and what i could have done better?**\n\nSo following this morning's thesis, we expected a drop and then a relief rally into tmw caused by the FOMC meeting.\n\nFor the first trade, I played the morning flush. PM QQQ was running and at a point even overbought. So what I did is I waited for a small run-up and then got some puts. In and out in under 2 minutes. nice scalp to start the day based on the Morning Flush strategy.\n\nThe second trade is where most of the action was and the one thing I believe I could have done better on this one is the entries. Instead of playing this trade on the 1 min chart, I believe I could have secured a better entry on the 5 min chart. With the starter position right when it bounced off 200MA.\n\nI started building a position as the QQQ was flirting with the 50\/200 MA and VWAP and then it shot up all the way to the resistance at 315.4. It got rejected there. HARD. This confirmed my theory and as alerted in the room, it was a bull trap. I averaged down on the way up, luckily I learned from my mistake last time and started small and waited it out. There was no volume to support that bounce. And another confirmation was massive waves on puts being bought by whales right before the knife. After one last reject QQQ knifed hard and this is where I exited the trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/eg5qcf6h23x81.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6032c12468146016dbb2499c3e2f23e2ff71caf\n\nSo to wrap things up great start to the week, I think tmw we might be bulls depending on how things play out today, which would be a first for this challenge, but remember as I always say we are not bulls or bears we are traders.\n\nIf you learned anything from me today, please follow my subreddit[ r\/theashshow](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/theashshow\/) for daily updates, strategies, and much more.\n\nAnd hop onto my discord (in the sub sidebar) if you want to discuss anything stock-related or need any help with trading (Free offcourse)\n\nAnd sub to my Youtube channel, ill start making videos soon!","answer":"That second trade is sketchy.

The US has really developed capital markets that make scaling ideas easy, favorable demographics, a high population with high internal mobility, strong property rights, high levels of immigration, abundant natural resources, etc. but I do want to focus on:\n\n&gt;having poor education...\n\nThis isn't really true. The US is about average [within OECD countries for pre-college education](https:\/\/gpseducation.oecd.org\/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=USA&amp;treshold=10&amp;topic=PI) and has by far the highest number of really good universities. Additionally, the US education system has benefited from attracting really smart and driven immigrants.

I\u2019m 25 by the way.","answer":"Check out this [compound interest calculator](https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/banking\/calculator\/compound-interest-calculator).

This is a phenomenal start and as you age and as your income increases you can add a little bit more. Time is definitely on your side. \n\nAs far as diversification, well, remember VTI holds EVERY single US stock and VXUS holds EVERY single international stock so you\u2019re all set in that regard. \n\nIf it was me personally, I would lower VTI to 60% and allot at least 10% in something a little more growth focused such as qqqm or qqqj or something like that."}
{"question":"Questions about opportunities as an accredited investor. I am not quite an accredited investor, but I have some mentors who are. They have shown me some insights into their investment opportunities. A lot of these opportunities out perform my current investments in index funds. \n\nIs this the norm? One of my mentors said, \"This is why the rich get richer. They have better opportunities available just due to the fact that they have more capital.\"\n\nWhat experience do you have investing in opportunities that are only available to accredited investors? What was the first opportunity you took once you became qualified as an accredited investor? How did you find out about that opportunity?","answer":"Many accredited investors don't perform better than index investors. There can potentially be good payoffs if you find a good opportunity to invest in, but there is also higher risk that your illiquid investment will turn out bad.\n\nThere's a tipping point with opportunity. For example the mega-rich like Warren Buffet actually have access to less opportunities than retail investors simply because they're dealing with so much capital. Smaller investors can afford to take on more risk for the potential of more return. A smaller investor can also invest in smaller companies that have high growth without outright buying the entire company. It's easier to double $1 than it is to double $1 million.\n\nAlternatively you can also look into offshore investments rather than accredited investing. There can be very high returns in untapped markets with similar or even less risk.\n\nI believe that there are good investment opportunities for investors of all sizes. It just involves work. Just because you're an accredited investor doesn't mean you get good opportunities slapped into your slap."}

{"question":"Order Flow and Options Manipulators: The Heinous Crimes of Citadel and Susquehanna A short story fan fiction posted on behalf of Wuz:\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZRfnWpV4i7E](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZRfnWpV4i7E)\n\nWhy are 75%+ of their portfolios in options?\n\nWhy are they paying brokers for their order flow?\n\nImagine you are playing poker, except you see half of the table's hands. This is the equivalent information of seeing 40% of order flow through your quant code. Next imagine you are playing roulette as the house except you get to choose where the ball lands. This is how they are abusing the options market with flash crashes, spikes, and EOD pricing. These metaphors are the essence of how these funds have stolen gigantic sums of money from retail traders.\n\nIf you were at a poker table where you could see certain opponents hands would you not be more inclined to play hands against them? The order flow they are paying for is almost exclusively retail investors. Who are they most inclined to manipulate and bet against? The shown hands of their opponents aka retail securities and options buyers. Did we forget what WSB was most known for? Options loss porn and margin calls. If you can see the entire retail options spread, while simultaneously having the ability to bet on your own options, you can tell the price points that facilitate the most pain for your order flow and additionally cash in your own bets to skew the cost\/profit equation of manipulating the price in your favor. Also, flash crashes and high volatility lend themselves to more margin calls and more pain for undercapitalized entities.\n\nSadly, it goes much much deeper than just these indiscretions. Not only are they betting against their own order flow, they are using it to win. Failure to Delivers does not only include short sale borrowing\u2026 It also includes when the buyer or seller of a security fails to deliver the share or payment. [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/f\/failuretodeliver.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/f\/failuretodeliver.asp)\n\nIn battleground stocks or stocks that have upcoming important dates or earnings calls these MMs are holding their buys and sells (converting them to FTDs) and using this \u201cammo\u201d to activate their own option spreads and decimating retail with easy to program quant data given to them from these broker's order flow. Cost analysis is the basis for most of these plays. I.e. It will cost us $XXX million to sell through X basis points and activate $XXX million worth of our options. Imagine if you don\u2019t even have to use your own shares\/capital to be doing the buying and selling: the possibilities for manipulation are truly endless and your cost\/benefit analysis will almost FOREVER be in your favor. And guess which stocks they will ultimately have the most \u201cammo\u201d for? The stocks bought and sold most heavily by retail. All they are required to do is deliver the share (eventually) or pay the broker for the sale - There is no record or tracking mechanism for the actual free market transaction. This is why they don't need to own shares - they get them daily from their order flow. This is also why the DTCC has put stronger restrictions on FTDs and non-delivery of securities.\n\n[Poker](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poker) and other games are an important part of the SIG company culture.

When GME mooned they had never had that many people \"win\" before they didn't have the cash to cover it.\n\nedit 3: The massive volume we are seeing in the after hours glitches is Citadel transferring shares back and forth to cover FTD\u2019s from shorts but also a metric shit ton of retail buys that they have never truly delivered to the brokers (don\u2019t panic your broker is still liable for your share even if Shitadel didn\u2019t buy it). The less shares they have to do these dark pool trades with the more frequently (higher volume) they need to trade the shares back and forth to cover the ever increasing FTD\u2019s. They are also using deep ITM calls as covers for their short interest. This is why we see a decrease in short interest, but no true upward buying pressure.

{"question":"DIVIDEND LOW COST ETF INVESTING - VYM, VIG, DGRO, VNQ, SPYD Hey everyone,\nI started investing in Jan, 2020 and got very interested in Dividend investing. Although one can research and invest in great companies for dividends and growth but still deciding which stock to buy could be tricky if someone like me is a passive investor.\nAfter looking at low cost ETF options such as VYM and combining them along with Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF such as VIG or DGRO seemed like a good option to me.\nI also think I can diversify it by investing in ETFs such as VNQ and SPYD which has more focus on REIT and Financial sector. Lastly I would like to include an S&amp;P 500 ETF for growth.\n\nCan this be a good option for someone like me who want to remain passive investor and focus more on other stuff rather than worrying about stock valuation and company performance?\n\nThanks in advance.","answer":"I think almost all of them are good options.\n\nBut what is generally your goal? What would you like to achieve?\n\nLive of dividends?\n\nYour goal will mostly answer your question.\n\nOn my blog I reviewed several of these Dividend aristocrat ETFS and VIG was the clear winner :-)"}
{"question":"Drop out of college or do real estate? Hey everyone! I\u2019m really looking for some advice. I\u2019m 27, in school for engineering. The problem is I just started, so I will most likely graduate in my mid 30s. That\u2019s not a huge issue, but a part of me wants to get into real estate. \n\nAny advice? School costs time and money, and real estate will cost time and me saving money. I guess I\u2019m tired of being close to 30 and still not having much money or much to show for. I really want to get into business and start making some real money.","answer":"You know what else will make you tired?\n\nBeing close to 60 and not having health insurance.\n\nIf you can get a degree in engineering that leads to full time employment, full speed ahead.  \n\nYou'll be in a much better position to invest in real estate with a steady paycheck."}
{"question":"The bank cleared my outstanding loan Can anyone shed some light on this? 40k loan taken out 20 years ago, halfway paid back and never missed a payment.

{"question":"Mom(67) 'retired' told me she has 70k in CC Debt,40k student loans What can I do? My mom told me she has 70k CC debt with ~10% interest rate and student loans at idk what type of interest rate. She has not had a job in 20 years. She has a few rental properties and makes about ~1k a month from them. \n\nMy mom has a history of being terrible with finances and I dont have any confidence in her to get out of debt. I am certain these debt numbers are actually worse than what she is telling me. What options does she have to reduce her interest rate\/payments?\n\nI am a single 29 male. I have some money saved up and have a decent job. I theoretically COULD help her out, but I am worried that if I did she would just end up in this hole again on her own... My mother told me she has about 20k that she uses to trade stocks. But shes the type of person to fall for pyramid and MLM schemes easily so I am sure that this is not a good method for her. \n\nI would guess she has ~100k in retirement savings.","answer":"Are you me? My mother was in a similar situation a few years back, \n\nFirst we looked at how much the rentals were costing her and how much she was truely making. It came out that after upkeep and age of the rentals that she was barely making any money on them. So we ended up looking into selling them and that paid alot of it down. \n\nFrom there she was getting SS for my dad and his pension. We refinanced her house from the absurd rate it was at down to a better rate. \n\nI then helped her with her Resume and talked to a few friends who still live in my hometown. Found a 3 day a week job being a secretary for a church. \n\n2-3 years later here she has almost no debt left, Student loan and the mortgage on her house. \n\nI never gave her money to change the situation but I always offered time and she took me up on that each time. So maybe some of these things I did could help you with her. I hope it goes well for you!"}

Has anyone here intentionally changed the way they dress or speak etc. to have gain access to better opportunities? Has anyone here ever been disturbed when they realized, at a rather mature age, that something that seems normal to them was a faux pas to the middle class?","answer":"I had a mixed up bringing..some lower, some mid and occasional awkward exposure to upper. I read a book that helped me to name these differences (at least some) like response to authority, relationship to money (low never borrow to upper always borrow).  The book is \"This Fine Place So Far From Home: Voices of Academics from the Lower Class\". A sociology text might be more comprehensive than this collection of personal essays on the topic but hearing about each person's struggle and their view from their discipline was fascinating."}
{"question":"Stock market and Crypto is tanking due to COVID variant concerns. Unless this is actually the end of the world, we'll see an eventual bounce back. And if it is the end of the world, you've got nothing to lose. This is potentially a repeat of what we saw in 2020, when markets crashed and then recovered as we got vaccine programmes in place. \n\nUnless this is literally the end of the world, life will go on in one way or another, and markets will adapt and continue to do their thing. I suspect crypto markets will do exactly the same. And if we are watching the end times, well what have you got to lose?\n\nThis could present a great buying opportunity if the same pattern occurs again.\n\nThe challenge is of course trying to get in at the best price. But if you work on the basis it's a flash crash, timing is probably not hugely important.","answer":"So crypto acts exactly the same as the stock market? I always thought so but shills are always talking about crypto like it's a protection against stock crashes, inflation etc. It's obviously not. It's all the same at the end of the day."}

{"question":"Bayesian Hierarchical Models for algorithmic trading? Before anyone comments \u201cBayesian inference is too computationally expensive\u201d hear me out. I do think there are lots of opportunities to leverage Bayesian hierarchical models in algorithmic trading. Being able to update inferences based on real time data could help infer a variety of variables in algotrading which may be conditionally independent on other variables. Sure, I could draw out a DAG and write some Stan code to estimate this. But in a fully automated trading system, idk how this could be done. Say you want to incorporate other asset classes, say how returns in one market move in another, model it as conditionally independent, set some vague priors, and move forward.\n\nFor one, I\u2019m trying to understand how one would actually build a strategy around this. Say your hierarchical model results have posterior distributions for volatility, returns, maybe sentiment scores if your using news, maybe also other assets. \n\nHas anyone here leveraged Bayesian inference? If so how has it helped your performance thus far? As a person with a statistics background I find Bayesian inference extremely invincible, but wonder how much it has helped for you guys.","answer":"Commenting for future reference. I too am interested in this. I\u2019ve just started looking into BHM\u2019s for Algotrading.

I've been learning to wheel recently and it's going pretty well, of course I'm making mistakes along the way but mostly failing to optimize profits, fortunately have not had any major losses.\n\nI want to trim my portfolio down, but since wheeling is capital intensive I don't want to put myself in a position where I'm restricted to low-value stocks, or forced to put my whole portfolio into a couple positions. I feel like there's probably a barrier of entry where wheeling gets significantly easier\/harder depending on which side of that barrier you're on.\n\nIdeally I would trim my portfolio to 10K or so and dedicate that strictly to wheeling, but I'm open to scaling up or down based on feedback here.\n\nSo for those of you that have had a wide range of capital, at what point did wheeling become significantly easier?","answer":"The important thing is being good at picking stocks (businesses that pay you income) that are undervalued. The wheel and other options strategies are the icing, but without a cake, you're gonna get a tummy ache.

(\u00a35000 over the year).\nWhich is why switching to an electric car for \u00a3270 per month seems to make sense.\nThe car in question is the cheapest one he can get (All government schemes and financial deals having been taken into account).\nAlso we don't know that his credit rating is bad, just that mine is likely better than his.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have only asked me as a potential last resort if they are unable to borrow the money themselves due to a poor credit rating.\nI have a good credit rating.\n\nPayments will be \u00a3270ish a month for 5 years.\nThey can easily afford this.\nI cannot unfortunately and am just making ends meet at the moment.\n\nI am worried about what happens in the event they are unable to make the payments due to unexpected circumstances.\nI have never had a loan before so unsure how it would work.\n\nThe investment of buying this particular car is thoroughly thought though and financially sound.

{"question":"Are we in a bubble? - Comparing the current stock market rally to the dot-com bubble! Lately, there has been growing chatter around whether the current rally that we are experiencing over the past one and half years is mainly driven by speculation and if we are in one of the largest investment bubbles ever.\n\n&gt;Why the Stock Market is in a bubble? - [Business Insider](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/stock-market-bubble-when-will-it-pop-powell-fed-stifel-2021-11)Investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dot-com bubble - [Bank of America](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/stock-market-crash-bank-of-america-warning-sign-shows-drop-2021-11)\n\nEven professional investors whom I consider level-headed and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable.\n\n&gt;This Will Not Last - [Nick Maggiulli](https:\/\/ofdollarsanddata.com\/this-will-not-last\/)\n\nAdding to all of this, we can see that the [Shiller PE Ratio is now climbing close to the 2000 dot-com bubble level.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/095t1dtniq281.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7db181ad101f44183162eae205bcdb5fb857e01f)\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to say that it\u2019s all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend, I feel that we might be missing the other side of the story. The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens. There is an immense difference in the available capital, interest rates, and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to 20 years back \\[1\\].\n\nSo what I wanted to analyze is: **Should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the \u2018new normal\u2019 given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in?** Finally, this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments! \\[2\\]\n\n**The Warning Signs**\n\nLet\u2019s first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market. (Spoiler alert \u2014 there are a lot of them!)\n\n**PE \/Shiller PE (CAPE)**\n\nThe price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the market\/company is overvalued when compared to historical trends. Shiller PE is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal PE.\n\nThe current concern is that as of Nov\u201921, the Shiller PE for the S&amp;P 500 crossed 40, which is **the highest reading in the last two decades**. The last time the Shiller PE crossed 40 was during the 2000 dot com bubble (The value reached only a max of 27 before the 2007 financial crisis).\n\nThe red flag here is that those who invested when the CAPE was above 40 last time (1999-\u201900) had to wait another 7 years to break even for a brief period of time (just before the 2007 housing market crash) and then wait another 5 more years before the market consistently settled above their buy-in price.\n\n**Money Supply Growth (Aka \u2018Money printer go brrr\u2019)**\n\n[1\/5th of all U.S Currency in circulation was printed in 2020.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fzax1ecriq281.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b59bc4f2bfde765ffab5deb3376ddae53b5fe4c3) While it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required, there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. One can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation.\n\n**Increasing use of leverage**\n\nThere are two ways of using leverage while investing. The first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options. Both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past 2 years.\n\n[This survey conducted by Magnifymoney](https:\/\/www.magnifymoney.com\/blog\/news\/debt-to-invest-survey\/) for almost 1,000 investors shows staggering results. 80% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market. More than 50% of the surveyed population borrowed more than $5k or more for investing. While leverage works great in a bull market, it can destroy your portfolio during downturns. \\[3\\]\n\n[Research by Goldman Sachs](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kkx1cfjtiq281.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8af5f2398c5273fc770ba1f6a265ad3ffcf1a7b) shows an even more concerning trend. Retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***. While this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity, E-Trade, etc., it\u2019s highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it.\n\n**Rise of new issues and speculative assets**\n\nMore than $600 Billion have been raised by IPO\u2019s this year. This is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the 2007 record in the dust. The cherry on top was [the Rivian IPO](https:\/\/marketsentiment.substack.com\/p\/rivian-ipo) where the company is now valued at more than $100 Billion with zero revenue and less than $50 Million in pre-order deposits.\n\nSPACs \\[4\\] also witnessed incredible growth with the number of SPACs jumping from a mere 59 in 2019 to 248 in 2020 and then a massive 559 in 2021 (As of Nov \u201921). The staggering rise in IPOs and SPACs showcases the availability of cheap capital and investors\u2019 desire to hold assets. This is very similar to the dot-com bubble where there was a [large spike in IPO\u2019s just before the crash.](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/270290\/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999\/)\n\nThis is without even getting into the speculative world of Crypto where [NFTs are being sold](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/this-cryptopunk-nft-just-sold-for-530-million-kind-of\/#:~:text=CryptoPunk%20%239998%2C%20part%20of%20a,for%20%24530%20million%20on%20Thursday.&amp;text=It's%20the%20most%20expensive%20NFT,ethereum%20%2D%2D%20about%20%24532%20million.) for more than half a billion dollars, a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of $27 Billion and there are now more ICOs than anyone can keep track of!\n\n**Investor expectations**\n\nMore than the P\/E ratio, **i**[nvestor expectations seem to be the highest in recent history.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qnfuyiqwiq281.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb279b8dae3bd9803be4b8f7bf26c1984f7a87b8) The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company's sales. As we can see on the chart below, more than double the companies are trading above 10x their sales when compared to the 2000 dot com bubble.\n\nIf you consider a [four-year time period](https:\/\/ofdollarsanddata.com\/this-will-not-last\/), stocks that had a very high P\/S ratio have underperformed those having low P\/S ratio since most companies don\u2019t grow as per expectations.\n\nNow that\u2019s a lot of bad news for anyone to digest! But,\n\n**Are we certain it\u2019s a bubble?**\n\nThere are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally. Just because we are in an impressive rally, it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash. Let\u2019s look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years.\n\n**Low-interest rates**\n\nThis is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the 2000s dot-com bubble. Between 1997 and 2000, the fed rate varied from 5 - 6% compared to the [historically low 0.25% that we have now](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x1408niziq281.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee123520c9b2ea0d2f9b10b59d6b2fd181fac446). This means that the capital available now is much cheaper (to prop up the economy after Covid) than it ever was. This is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns.\n\n**New Investors**\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that we all hate Robinhood. [But the data they put out during their IPO filing](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lpojhko0jq281.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ede81940da2355edc282ba1feca54bad415c4b0) shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investors\/traders coming to the market. All of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now.\n\n**401(k) and Index funds**\n\nAs I have highlighted in [one of my previous article](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/piyri4\/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried\/)s, the amount of inflow US index funds receive is massive (more than $50 Billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the Vanguard 500 index fund this year) and index funds are expected to make up [more than 50% of the fund market](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2021\/04\/the-autopilot-economy\/618497\/). According to [this report](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/08\/19\/401k-balances-hit-a-new-all-time-high-fidelity-says-.html) from Fidelity, the average 401(k) account now has a balance of $129K and 12% of workers increased their contribution.\n\nThe key point being: all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market \\[5\\].\n\n**What\u2019s the implication?**\n\nAs long as the above factors remain as is (Fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital) we might see the party go on much longer than expected.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe market of 2021 is significantly different when compared to the 2000s. As we can see there are more investors, cheaper capital, and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before. So I feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dot-com bubble is a tad wrong.\n\nBut, that\u2019s not to say that all is well. Almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future.\n\nThe expected annual return by investors [above inflation is a whopping 17.5%](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/b4vspq13jq281.png?width=928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa81e2478da9eb80ba1b001e0a2c6b29d9313b97)(which is 161% more than what is realistic) \u2014 This is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly double-digit return is the norm.\n\nEven if we are in a dot-com bubble-like scenario, [this thread from Corry Wang](https:\/\/twitter.com\/corry_wang\/status\/1345192541545766915) perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble.\n\nBasically, even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in 2000 (Investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to Tulip mania as early as \u201898), **making money using that information was hard!** There were a few investors such as Mark Cuban and John Templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed, but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected.\n\nIt makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market. But, pundits have been calling a [crash from as far back as 2017](https:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/08\/10\/stock-market-crash-today-down-bubble-2017\/). Right now based on fundamentals, the chances do look far higher. It does make sense to not make significant one-time investments in the market now. But, changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best long-term strategy!\n\nAs Peter Lynch quoted,\n\n&gt;Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves\n\nUntil next week\u2026\n\n**Footnotes and Existing Research**\n\n\\[1\\] The amount of commission charged per trade before the rise of the zero-commission trading model was staggering.

{"question":"The Tenant Fees Act 2019 comes into force today! Reminder to dispel confusion around your rights as a tenant.\n\nFor properties in England, the Tenant Fees Act 2019 means that in addition to rent, lettings agents can only charge tenants (or anyone acting on the tenant\u2019s behalf) the following permitted payments:\n\n1. Holding deposits (a maximum of 1 week\u2019s rent)\n\n2. Deposits (a maximum deposit of 5 weeks\u2019 rent for annual rent below \u00a350,000, or 6 weeks\u2019 rent for an annual rental of \u00a350,000 and above)\n\n3. Payments to change a tenancy agreement eg. change of sharer (capped at \u00a350 or, if lower, any reasonable costs)\n\n4. Payments associated with early termination of a tenancy (capped at the landlord\u2019s loss or the agent\u2019s reasonably incurred costs)\n\n5. Utilities, communication services (eg. telephone, broadband), TV licence and council tax\n\n6. Interest payments for the late payment of rent (up to 3% above Bank of England\u2019s annual percentage rate)\n\n7. Reasonable costs for replacement of lost keys or other security devices\n\n8. Contractual damages in the event of the tenant\u2019s default of a tenancy agreement and\n\n9. Any other permitted payments under the Tenant Fees Act 2019\n\nThe Act also states that agents and landlords don\u2019t have to pay back any fees they have charged a tenant before 1st June 2019. So, if an agent or landlord requires a tenant to pay a fee linked to a contract that started before the ban came into force, such as check-out or renewal fees, they can continue charging those fees until 31st May 2020. \n\nRightmove: https:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/news\/articles\/property-news\/what-does-the-new-tenant-fees-act-mean-for-you\/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=campaign\n\nMSE: https:\/\/www.moneysavingexpert.com\/news\/2019\/01\/letting-fees-to-be-banned-from-june\/","answer":"Rents are generally set by what tenants (as a market) are able\/willing to pay, not by what the landlord needs or wants. If the removal of these extra charges results in less money in the landlord's pocket, then that doesn't directly mean they can successfully put up the rent to compensate. However, if knowing that they won't have to pay extra charges or come up with a large deposit increases the budget that prospective tenants have for finding a place to live, then that *will* increase rents to match.\n\nThis will all be complicated by the fact that most of these charges will have come from estate agents and not landlords directly, so now it's a multi-way balance between rents, management fees charged to the landlord, profits to the estate agent and profits to the landlord. Things might be shaken up slightly, but I expect markets will settle down again such that no-one is significantly better or worse off. Unless the supply or demand of properties to rent, and agents to manage or find tenants for them, changes then it will probably all balance back to the same points again."}
{"question":"Is this a tenant from hell or am I a bad landlord? First timer here. Recently completed my first rehab and placed a tenant the other month.

{"question":"My Sales journey, $1mm at 29 Title: $1mm NW at 29 Software Sales FIRE Journey\n\nWanted to share my journey to FIRE and long term plans in case anyone else was curious about options to hit FI fast or FatFIRE without becoming an engineer, lawyer, or going FAANG.  For the majority of my career I\u2019ve worked in software as a service (SaaS) sales.  \/r\/financial independence didn't show me any love, hopefully it's more appropriate here.  \n\nLost my job in December after some management changes, took a sabbatical for 4 months, and started a new one about 4 months ago.  Last gig was mid-market sales and I was driven to be the top rep.  There was a very quarterly driven cadence and I much preferred to work major deals or ones that would feed me in the future.  I succeeded, getting rep of the year in 2019, #1 out of 140 with $6mm in total contract value.  Then I was fired 8 months later for performance. My 2020 numbers slipped with COVID, what have you done for me lately?\n\nThe sabbatical put everything into perspective.  Rise and grind is a toxic attitude and taking time away from sales culture made me realize I was addicted to working.  Sales glorifies folks working on their days off, going to ridiculous lengths to close a deal, and spending your money as soon as you get it.  Stories available by request for each.  As the saying goes, a sales manager loves when his reps have a baby, a luxury car payment, and an addiction.  Taking time off then working from home to get away from it made me like myself more as a person.  That said, Sales is absolutely the right career move to get to FIRE as fast as possible without investing years to learn a new skill like coding.  I don\u2019t regret it. \n\nNow taking a much more laid back approach to work since I realized the stress wasn\u2019t worth it.   New job is Enterprise sales and much more long-term focused.  While the accounts are bigger and the problems more complex, it\u2019s much easier for me to deep dive learn the business of a handful of companies than dozens.  \n\nI can make $400k+ grinding 60+ hours per week including Sundays, riding around in Ubers 7am-8pm for face to face meetings, drinks, and dinners, or I can make $250k-$350k doing it from home starting at 8, cutting out at 5pm (3 on Fridays), going to the gym, and getting a good night sleep.  Competing to be a top performer is stressful.  Chilling out and helping people with the problems they\u2019re explicitly trying to solve is not.  \n\n\n**Goals**\n\nRetire at 32 so my partner can take an international job which moves around every 2 years and I can get promoted to trophy husband.  I\u2019d like to get to $1.6mm before then, but I\u2019d be ok with doing FIREing at $1.3mm since housing will be taken care of by her gig.

After 2 bosses got fired, the Controller delaying commission checks because \u201cI think you sales people get paid too much,\u201d and having to do deal reviews with an operations director who had no experience selling I knew my time was over here.  Learned not to work at super early stage startups and all the weird rules of back door IRAs.\n\n**2018: Income - $160k.  Assets at EoY - $234k.  Spent - $40.5k**\n\nNew job at a best in breed company.  In my first year win a few accolades, speak at our annual kick off conference, and building a solid book of business for next year.  New company offers a mega backdoor 401k, start maxing it out along with the above.  \n\n\n**2019: Income - $415k.  Assets at EoY - $606k*.  Spent: $42.5k**\n\nThings come together.  Close my first $1mm+ deal, then closed another one 8 months later.  Tons of accolades, talks of big promotions, and lots of prestige.  My partner started grad school so my rent went up significantly.\n\n* I think this number might have pulled forward some of the last few years assets since I did a bunch of consolidation and Mint doesn\u2019t do well with this sort of thing.  \n\n\n**2020: Income - $340k.  Assets at EoY: $880k.  Spent - $44.5k**\n\nOffered a promotion in January, but turned it down for a variety of personal and professional reasons.  Tax man cometh, owed 35k in April.  Verbally offered a much bigger promotion I planned to accept in July which ultimately a new VP blocked.  That should have been the writing on the wall, but I had a rough half because of COVID and was recently let go.  That evening a C-suite client I\u2019d been working with texted and emailed me asking if I was ok and immediately offered to connect me with his sales leadership if I wanted a job.  \n\n\n**2021: Income: Tracking for $250k, assets today: $1mm.  Spent - On track for $45.5k**\n\nReceived competing offers from 2 companies, one a start up and one a well established player.  Decided I was done with the stress that comes with building a team so took the established player despite it being $15k less.  Negotiated a 4 month sabbatical so I could unwind.  Spent that time hiking, reading (up to 43 books so far this year), practicing my hobbies like chess, handwriting (was chicken scratch), working out, and cooking.  Travelled a little, spent a ton of time with my family, recorded an interview with my mom about her childhood (favorite part), and visited my partner at grad school.  New job is good, though it has it\u2019s bullshit.  Tax Man Cometh again.  Owed the IRS $35k in 2021.  Partner got a job that should lead us to living abroad in a few years when I retire.\n\n\n**Spending:**\n\nTended to live on the road for work so got all of my weeknight dining and happy hours (entertainment or peer coaching) taken care of by the company.  Pre-COVID almost all the companies I\u2019ve worked for provided breakfast and lunch.  All the same my partner and I like to do a fancy dinner once a quarter and take out once a week.  We\u2019ve gotten a free vacation from my work 3\/6 years which we like to extend.  On the years we don\u2019t we\u2019ve done a reasonably priced vacation of about $1000-$2000\/person almost always paid for with points. \n\n\n**Lifestyle Inflation:**\n\nI\u2019m a regular at a local watering hole that used to cost $4\/beer when I moved here and now charges $12.  Rent has gone up because I used to live with my partner but she\u2019s in grad school.  When I moved here I was paying $750\/month, now it\u2019s $2,000\/month.  When I first graduated making ~50k\/year I lived on about $32k after taxes.  Last year after making 340k I spent $44k.  Now that my partner is back I\u2019ll probably land closer to $35-$40k per year.\n\n\nOver the last 3 years I purchased 2 luxury watches that set me back a total of $51k.  Had both of them assessed this weekend and was offered a total of $74k.  Selling on the private market they\u2019re worth closer to $93k.  These purchases were excluded from my annual spend metrics since they represent one-off purchases and would completely skew the numbers.  \n\n\nOverall I could have definitely spent less on food, booze, and toys.  Know I could keep grinding at this and have $10m+ after 20 years, but I think 50 year old me would want the 20 years of freedom more.","answer":"I think maybe you're getting downvoted because the post comes across frankly... super sales-y. \n\nI used to work in sales compensation at a large SAAS company, and the cheapest way to keep Sales people happy was make up awards.

Why would that be?\n\nI suspect hedgies have been piggy backing on interest rate raises and dumping to make it look like there was a huge effect. Everybody then panic sells and the hedgies clean house with their shorts.\n\nThe hedgies aren't dumping. Why? Because they can't figure out what to do about GameStop. If it dumps along with everything else they know we'll just lock up the remaining shares for shits and giggles. If it holds or rises while titans like Alphabet and Amazon are dumping people aren't going to wait around to figure out why.

{"question":"In November 2021, I had $70,000 at 21 years old. In June of 2022, I had $0 and $5,000 in debt. Here's how I did it. August 2020 I started DCAing when btc was around 10k. Minimum wage delivery driver. Put everything onto a hardware wallet.\n\nJanuary 2021 holdings already were mind blowing when it hit 25-28k. I discovered Celsius during this time. I removed all the money from my hardware wallet onto celsius, took out loans, redeposited the loaned crypto, and took out more loans against the borrowed crypto.\n\nKept delivering food, spent every dollar on BTC . Threw it into celsius and kept borrowing against the assets.\n\nAugust 2021 Parents kicked me out of house. I had about $50,000 of btc and e. I didn't want to cash out because I thought it was going higher. So I lived in my car and continued delivering food. I didn't eat, and instead spent all money earned on BTC and put into celsius.\n\nI lived in my car and delivered food for probably 3 months. \n\nNovember 2021, I had about $70,000 and a paid off car.\n\nDecember 2021, 1 month after the top, I applied and got approved for multiple credit cards. I balance transferred probably $7,000 and bought the top.\n\nJanuary 2022, I had $6,000 in a Roth IRA. I cashed out of the Roth IRA and used all that money to put into BTC.\n\nI learned how to use defi, and transfered some money out of celsius onto defi, and thought I was making money.\n\nJune 2022 comes around, Celsius runs with all my money. All I had left was whatever money I transferred to defi. I took that money, paid off whatever I could, and moved back in with my parents.\n\nJune 2022, I had 0 dollars invested. 0 dollars in cash. $5,000 in credit card debt.\n\nJuly 2022 I continued delivering food trying to erase the credit card debt. BTC finds new lows, and I had no money to invest.\n\nSeptember 2022 I find a sales job and use the money to pay off the debt and DCA into BTC.\n\nDecember 2022 I get fired from the sales job for not hitting the numbers but I leave debt free and with 1k cash and 1k dollars worth of btc.\n\nToday, I am back to delivering food living with my parents with no debt, but only 1k cash and 1k dollars of btc to my name.\n\nIt is the bottom, only up from here, and I am scrambling to try and get back to where I once was. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get to the BTC stack I once had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLessons learned:\n\nI will only buy bitcoin from now on in terms of currencies.\n\nI will only use a hardware wallet from now on.\n\nI will try to learn to spend money from now on so I don't see $70,000 melt away for nothing.\n\nI will try to learn to diversify just a tad bit more so that way the pain isn't as bad during bear markets.\n\nI will try to resist balance transferring my credit cards, but I truly can't promise myself that I won't do this again in the future, because I really might.

{"question":"PLEASE READ: The Importance of Taking Profits During Stock Rebounds Like Today Hey Reddit!  Looks like today is a GREAT day to be in a lot of sectors - seeing green all around - finally!  Whether you're a seasoned investor or brand new to this, **just want to remind you all that there is NOTHING wrong with taking profits off the table during these rebound sessions.**\n\nCovid has made a very interesting market right now where often different sectors push and pull the market in inverse ways.  Often one dips and the others push.  Airlines versus tech is a great example of this.  \n\nDon't be afraid to sell one side of the equation and take some money off the table, to later reinvest in the same sector, or another sector that is dipping.  **You DONT ALWAYS have to yolo and go in for the long run - even a few thousand in winning is still GREAT.**  \n\n**If after rebounds you're still down, take an honest look at whether to cut losses and reinvest in a different sector.  The expression 'down with the ship' is often used, but even if you laugh about it and post a meme - at the end of the day you've still lost money - and there's nothing really funny about that, regardless of how you rationalize it.**\n\nThe key question is: When exactly do you take profits? Most traders take profits either too early and leave money on the table. Or they take profits too late\u2014after a stock has already made a high and is now turning around. In this article, I will show you my favorite profit-taking strategy for stock market trading.\n\n**What Is a Profit-Taking Strategy?**\n\nA profit-taking strategy defines when exactly you sell your stock (or option) to realize a profit. Many traders don\u2019t have a profit-taking strategy in place when trading. Often they say:\u00a0*\u201cI\u2019ll sell the stock when I've made enough money.\u201d* The problem: There\u2019s never \u201cenough money.\u201d\u00a0  \n\n\nOften traders are too greedy and expect ONE stock to make up for all the money they lost in the past. That\u2019s why they hold onto a stock for too long. These days, trends are short-lived, and markets can turn around on a dime. If you don\u2019t have a solid profit-taking strategy for your trading, you could end up leaving a lot of money on the table!\n\n**How Do You Create an Exit Strategy?**\n\nI personally like to keep it simple. Here\u2019s a simple, yet powerful, profit-taking strategy: P = 2 x R\n\nThis means: Take profits when you make twice as much money as you risk. Here\u2019s an example: I highly recommend using the 2% rule for your risk, i.e., you should never risk more than 2% of your trading account on any given trade. So. if you have a $10,000 account, don\u2019t risk more than 2% = $200. When you risk $200, you should take profits as soon as you make $400. With a simple profit-taking strategy like that, you will make money even if you\u2019re wrong half of the time.\n\n**Advanced Profit-Taking Strategies**\n\nHere\u2019s the challenge...when you're using the\u00a0simple profit-taking strategy\u00a0that I outlined above, you might leave some profits on the table. Because when a stock is more volatile, you could get 3 x R, or maybe even more. As an example, when you look at the stock SLCA, you could easily get 5 x R, i.e., you could get $1,000 for every $200 that you risk. In this case, what do you do? Do you try to get 5 x R, even though it is more aggressive? Or do you stick with the more conservative 2 x R?\n\n**Is There a Best Way to Exit a Trade?**\n\nHere\u2019s what I personally like to do. I like to use the best of both worlds. I take profits for 1\/2 of my position when I see 2 X R, and then I take the remainder of the profits when the stock gets to my optimized profit target, i.e., 5 x R.\n\nHere\u2019s an example:\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re trading 100 shares of ABC. Your risk is $2 per share, i.e. $200 for 100 shares. Your conservative profit target is 2 X R = 2 x $2 = $4. Your optimized profit target is 5 X R = 5 x $2 = $10.  \n\n\nI personally sell 50 of the 100 shares as soon as I can get $4 in profits per share. In this case, I would make 50 x $4 = $200. Now I cut the stop loss for the remaining 50 shares in half. Instead of risking $2 per share, I will now risk only $1 per share. Since I have 50 shares left, my risk is now reduced from $200 to $50. But the best: since I already sold half of my shares, I already made $200.\u00a0\n\nThis money has been deposited into my account. So, if the stock turns around now and I get stopped out, I only give back $50 of these $200. Therefore, my total profit for this trade would be $150.\n\nAs you can see, once I take profits, I cannot lose on this trade anymore\u2014even if the stock turns around. And if it keeps going up, I can sell the remaining 50 shares when the stock moves up $10, which is my optimized target. In this case, I would realize an additional $500 for a total of $700.\n\n**3 Different Profit-Taking Strategies**\n\nLet\u2019s recap:\n\n1. **Conservative Profit Taking Strategy:**  \nIn this case, you would risk $200 to make $400. Not bad.\n2. **Optimized Profit Taking Strategy:**  \nIn this case, you would risk $200 to make $1,000. Sounds better, but it\u2019s less likely. The stock might turn around and you get stopped out before the stock reaches this aggressive target.\n3. **My \u201cBest of Both Worlds\u201d Profit-Taking Strategy:**  \nIn this case, you would risk $200, and as soon as the stock moves up by $4, you take profits for half of your position. Now you can\u2019t lose anymore and have a \u201cfree trade\u201d that hopefully achieves your optimized profit target.\n\nI can relax, sit back, and don\u2019t have to worry about this trade anymore. If everything works out, I\u2019m making $700 on this trade. If it doesn\u2019t work out, I still make $150.\n\n**Important!**\n\nThis example is for an account of $10,000, and if you get the $700 in profits, you make 7%\u2014on one trade! That\u2019s pretty good! As you can see, THIS is smart trade management.","answer":"You don't need a stock to double in order to take profits.  Of course it depends on the costs of trading, but if see a nice 10-20% jump over your purchase price, you should start thinking about taking profits.  Any stock that you sell for a profit has the practical effect of lowering the amount paid in your existing shares.  Basically the same effect of lowering cost per share that \"buying the dip\" has.  \n\nFor example, if you have 1000 shares of a stock at $1 and it goes up to $1.20, you can sell say 200 shares.  That nets you $240 back.  So now you have 800 remaining shares that you have essentially paid $760 for, or $.95 per share.  I call it averaging down, although it isn't technically averaging down.  But if you do this is you see green, especially early after you buy a new stock, it gives you lots more leeway in riding out down cycles and not seeing ugly huge red percentages.  The other thing it does is free up cash so that you can buy the dips on other stocks that may have dropped that you want to average down on.  \n\nI get that you need to pick some stocks that actually go up... but when it does happen (and it will), you need to be ready to \"sell the bump.\""}

{"question":"100k Update! 27, no kids, married. chugging along. TL;DR - philosophy majors and retired baristas sold soul to the man to get freedom to waste more time in school later\n\nI tally up NW every month at the end of the month, and it finally crossed the 100k threshold! I've been a reader in this community for a while but never had anything to post. My husband and I haven't made stupid money the past few years *and* invested in a masters program *and* still have student loans so I wanted to give the lowdown so that any people like us can get a snapshot of how it's gone (and also hear from like-minded people.)\n\nOverview: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Do74z57](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Do74z57)\n\nOur goals are to have the freedom to take lower paying passion jobs or go get a phd when we want to. We want kids in a few years, want to own a home, American dream etc.\n\nI've been tracking monthly for almost 2 years, which is the time period when we began really saving for retirement and focusing on FI. In the images, I marked some important milestones on my chart, but the summary of our post-undergrad life has been that we both graduated with liberal arts degrees, moved to HCOL east coast city, made coffees, I took a data bootcamp and became an analyst, spouse started a masters, he graduated in 2020 from masters and now we both have salaried employment. His masters was something he's interested in, but not something that drives his earning potential. He got his current job before he finished and it's in an unrelated field. \n\nI'm now a software product manager and he works in sales operations at a startup, so our earning potential should be solid. Although, we both are interested in academia and I want to get a masters\/phd in an academic field, so a big drive for FI for us is being able to take low paying jobs down the road or go to school when we want to. I am applying for masters programs that would put me in a field I'm interested in but not necessarily make me more money, so these early investments are really important to our financial independence down the road. \n\nSome notes:\n\n* We paid his masters as we went, which I was able to do with my salary. I was happy to avoid taking on more debt, but in retrospect it may have been smarter to start investing more earlier and take out more loans, hard to say. \n* We are currently saving for a down payment on a house, which is why 50k of our money is in liquid savings.\n* We're not especially entrepreneurial and really enjoy working, so it's more about FI than RE for us. We both really like learning and research and public policy so we want the flexibility to pursue what we are interested in. \n* We're fortunate to both have been able to work remote through the pandemic and both actually get raises. Huge boon to our goals.\n\nAnyway, curious to hear if there are others like us on this sub!

{"question":"I had a goal of hitting $1M net worth by 30; after a lot of ups and downs, I finally hit it! I have been following this sub for a very long time (this is not my main reddit account), and since then I have learnt a lot from it. Since I graduated from university, my goal was to hit $1M by the time I was 30.\n\nMy biggest learning from this journey so far has been to relax and not worry about where every single dollar is going. I know it sounds sort of counter intuitive, but for me it was causing some stress when an unexpected expense would come. Not because I did not have the money, but because I was not going to hit my savings target for that month. I know everyone is not like me, but I am quite disciplined, so I decided not to track my net worth for ~2.5 years.\n\nHere is a snippet of my journey. \n\nMy family moved to Canada from south asia when I was in my early teens (I think my family came over with less than $15k), and we didn't have much growing up. So I understood what it took to live frugally. Fast forward to when I graduated from highschool, my family was a middle class family in Canada and it was all because of my parents tight handed approach to disposable income.\n\nI graduated at age 23, and I was lucky enough to not have any debt. I had scholarships and worked throughout University and saved up enough from my work terms that I did not need student loans after 2nd year. And I paid the first 2 years off by the time I graduated with money left over.\n\n**Year 1** - I graduated from a STEM discipline and I was lucky enough to get a very good paying job right off the bat. My salary was a hair over six figures when I started. Towards the middle of my first year after graduating, I was able to buy a house (property #1) in the small town I was living in. I started to rent out the basement and a room up top so it would cover my mortgage and I paid for the utilities, repairs and taxes. \n\n**Year 2** - I had saved up enough to buy make a down payment for a condo in the city I grew up in, at this time I was living extra frugally, and the same old car I bought at the end of university. I ended up buying this condo in one of the hot markets in Canada (property #2). I also got a raise this year, and every subsequent year until Year 7. I also had a side hustle going which was paying for 75% of my living expenses at the time.\n\n**Year 3** - I got a promotion and my company decided to move me, they promised to pay my housing expenses in this new city, so I ended up renting the entire house I had bought and started making a bit of money on it. I continued living frugally, and was saving as much as I could. I stopped the side hustle, since it was affecting my work life balance.\n\n**Year 4** - My company continued paying my expenses and I continued my journey towards FI, but at this point, as discussed I was getting stressed about not hitting my savings goals due to some unexpected expenses. \n\n**Year 5** - I moved back to the original small town I was living in, and at this time, I had saved enough money, that I decided to buy another rental condo (property #3) in the same hot Canadian market. Two months later, I lost my house (property #1) due to a fire. This was not an easy time for me, and with some back and forth with the insurance company, which took 6 months, they decided to cover all the expenses, and I ended up rebuilding the house. At this point I moved in with my parents and I stopped recording where all my savings were going. To get the rebuild going, since I was having insurance issues, I had to drawdown all my savings and anything that was liquid to the point where I had less than $2.5k in my bank account. I wanted the rebuild done right away for reasons I won\u2019t get into. \n\n**Year 6** \u2013 My house was completely rebuilt and I sold it right after. Took, all the money I got from the house and dumped it back into the stock market (Combination of ETFs and Stocks).\n\n**Year 7** \u2013 Due to my division in the company performing poorly, I was packaged out. I knew it was coming (our management sucked), so I was already looking into other companies, and I was unemployed for 2 weeks before I joined my current company. It was a fairly decent package, and the job I found after paid me relatively the same.  \n\nAt this time it brings me to today, where I sat down this weekend and went through every account I have to calculate my net worth. I knew I was going to be close to the $1M mark, but I actually did not expect to exceed it. Currently I am sitting at $1.15M, which was very surprising for me, and I had to triple check all my numbers. I lucked out on my properties I bought as rental properties since that local market has done extremely well, so for this calculation I used the govt. assessed values (again I know it is only a paper gain, but I have no plan on selling these properties).\n\n**Here is the breakdown \u2013**\n\n**Cash\/Savings Acc**  - $65K (saving for a down payment on a new property, but to live in)\n\n**Stocks\/ETFs** \u2013 $420K \n\n**RRSP** \u2013 $50K (similar to 401k)\n\n**TFSA** \u2013 $60K (similar to Roth)\n\n**Self\/Company Contribution (LIRA)** \u2013 $115K\n\n**Company Stocks (First company)** \u2013 $140K\n\n**Property #2 Equity** \u2013 $200K \n\n**Property #3 Equity** \u2013 $100K\n\nI would be lying if I said there was no luck involved and some things played in my favor (like minimal housing expenses).\nFuture plans, I want to keep on doing what I am doing and save and live semi-frugally. I have always spent on vacations; travelling is very important for me. I finally have a newer new car, and I turn 30 this month. I want to buy a house of my own soon and most likely I will own this house for 20-30 years. \n\nPlease feel free to ask me my questions; I will do my best to answer them. \n\nEDIT 1: Formatting\n\nEDIT 2: Maybe I should have stated from the beginning, which is my fault, but all the numbers are in $CAD.\n","answer":"Obligatory I graduated with two solid degrees (bio\/finance) and have just figured my life out at 34.

{"question":"Anyone here wheeling SOFI? Pretty high IV on what seems to be viewed as a strong company with a strong future. I'm probably missing an obvious risk of their downside. In April and May I debated buying SOFI shares (when it was still trading as IPOE), but decided I'll pass for now. Instead, it was trading a little over $15 at the time, I decided I'd sell Jan 2022 $15 strike puts (one in April, another in May as SOFI dropped in share price). These offered a healthy, average premium of $3.84, which given the \\~8 months to expiration seemed to make sense to me as it's basically getting SOFI a bit over $11\/share if it dropped below the strike.\n\nSince then, SOFI has done well and is trading just over $21\/share today. Now I haven't done a lot of research, but from what little browsing I've done I tend to hear\/read it in a positive light with a strong future outlook.\n\nI went browsing SOFI again as I'm a bit light in my financial industry exposure and thought I'd check their option chain. To my surprise, the premiums on SOFI are pretty big. A simple example is that right now (SOFI trading at $21.10) a $20 strike 7\/16 put trades for $1.93\/$2.00 bid-ask spread with a Delta on this of 0.37.\n\nThis is nearly a 10% return if SOFI simply trades flat (or even down \\~5%) for the next month. Is there something obvious I'm missing with SOFI where they have some high risks coming up that could crush their share price (maybe some kind of lockup expiration)? The premiums are simply higher than I would expect.","answer":"The IV\/Premiums are high because it fluctuates alot. I hold shares and have explored selling calls on them but I always find myself thinking \"this could easily run past $25 in the next 45 days, and I really want to hold on to my shares\", so I just let them ride. It's not crazy enough money that I'm willing to deal with rolling and actively managing a call.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 10th, 2022.\n\n# **Inflation, rising rates and the Federal Reserve could whip stocks around in the week ahead - [(Source)](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/01\/07\/inflation-rising-rates-and-the-federal-reserve-could-whip-stocks-around-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The bond market could again set the course for the week ahead, after rapidly rising interest rates gave stocks a choppy start to the new year.\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, key inflation reports are expected, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to testify Tuesday at his nomination hearing before a Senate panel, while the hearing on Fed Governor Lael Brainard\u2019s nomination to the post of vice chair is set for Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; The week also marks the start of the fourth-quarter earnings period with reports from major banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInflation and the Fed continue to be the theme next week, but I do think we\u2019re looking forward to have some earnings results to sink our teeth into,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cWe do think it\u2019s going to be a good quarter and a good year for earnings, which is why we\u2019re generally upbeat on the prospect for earnings.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said the markets will focus predominantly on the Powell and Brainard hearings, the consumer price index on Wednesday and the producer price index the next day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s unrealistic to assume the earnings become the page-one story, and the Fed monetary policy becomes the page-two story,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks had a rough first week to 2022, as bond yields rose on both high expectations for Fed interest rate hikes and the view that the omicron variant of Covid is heading for a peak in a matter of weeks. Yields move higher when bonds sell off.\n*****\n&gt; Tech was particularly hard hit, with the Nasdaq Composite down 4.5% for the week, while the Dow was barely negative, down just 0.3%. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund was off 4.6% as of Friday afternoon. But banks moved higher on the prospect that rising interest rates would help earnings. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund was up 5.4% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 4677, down 1.9%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis week was a wake-up call for what we\u2019re going to be dealing with for 2022,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cLower returns and more risk. Welcome to the new year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Yields rose rapidly across the curve, but the dramatic move of the benchmark 10-year was particularly rattling for investors. The 10-year, which influences mortgages and other loans, rose from 1.51% in the final hour of 2021 trading to as high as 1.80% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; That makes it the second-biggest move in the yield for the first week of the year in 20 years, according to Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s more dramatic than what we anticipated and the Fed\u2019s pivot to a more hawkish stance has been the surprise,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cMost market participants expected higher rates, less accommodative monetary policy, but when you look at the fed funds implying a 90% chance of a hike in March, on New Year\u2019s Eve that was just 63%. There\u2019s been a pretty dramatic change in tone picked up in the Fed minutes this week and markets are adjusting to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell\u2019s hearing on Tuesday will be a highlight of the coming week, not because he is expected to make news, but because he is likely to echo the tone of the Fed minutes, released this past Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank revealed in those minutes that officials are also discussing when to start shrinking its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has already forecast tightening policy with three quarter-point interest rate hikes this year, and downsizing its bond holdings would tighten it even further.\n*****\n&gt; Bond investors also reacted to the disappointing December jobs report Friday by sending interest rates higher. There were just 199,000 jobs created last month, less than half of what was expected. But the unemployment rate fell more than expected, to 3.9% from 4.2%. Average hourly wages rose by 0.6%, or 4.7% year over year.\n*****\n&gt; Economists blamed the weaker report in part on a lack of workers to fill jobs, but the Fed is expected to move to hike interest rates regardless.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the Fed saying we\u2019re at full employment. There is still a gap, but the wage surge was much more than anyone expected and heavily concentrated in low-wage jobs,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cWe\u2019re about 3.5 million shy of the previous peak, and the labor market is behaving as if we\u2019re beyond full employment.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Inflation will stay front and center with the CPI and PPI reports. Economists expect another hot month for both readings, though some economists believe inflation is close to its peak. November\u2019s headline CPI of 6.8% was the highest since 1982.\n*****\n&gt; Stock investors will also continue to watch yields. Tech and growth stocks are the most sensitive to rising rates because investors pay for the promise of future earnings. Higher rates mean the cost of money increases and that changes the calculus on their investments.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski expects the 10-year yield to reach 2.25% by the end of the year, though it has been moving faster than expected. \u201cGetting there sooner causes more pain ... in those longer duration equity sectors, like tech and the Nasdaq,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think that yields settle down and that tech comes back. I think we\u2019re going to see really good earnings this year. Tech continues to be a beneficiary.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said the market could see a 10% decline in 2022, but he doubts that slump will happen in the near term because there is so much cash waiting to come into the market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this dry powder will be put to work. I think we\u2019re off to a kind of rough start and a reset,\u201d he said. \u201cI think ultimately this reset of expectations is going to be a healthy one. I do think market participants are getting a very early in the year wake-up call after the high returns and low volatility of last year and a doubling of the market in three years. [But] it\u2019s going to be much rougher sledding in the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There are also three big Treasury auctions in the coming week, with the $52 billion 3-year note auction Tuesday, $36 billion in 10-year bonds Wednesday, and $22 billion in 30-year bonds Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year popped as high as 1.80% Friday, but could easily return to that level in the coming week. That puts it just above the 2021 high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn and around those levels, the market will try to find some short term support,\u201d said Greg Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities. He added that the auction could be an event that helps cap the yield move for now.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Vw1fKEv.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sDU81Xv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vPA1qoo.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Nt26kGZ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gDZiArY.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/i5wEmPo.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/86t4iVg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback\/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mvLdJ9Y.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lRLkFsc.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/A3JLkrA.jpg))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Puccq7U.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/DdkUq8g.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qD0wu1c.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NoQ0noV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/QaRXjwJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/geDLvzb.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Yale Hirsch\u2019s Santa Claus Rally &amp; January Barometer, Trifecta 2 out of 3 Ain\u2019t Bad\n\n&gt; My father Yale Hirsch invented both of these well-known seasonal indicators in 1972 and published them in the 1973 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanacas you can see in the picture above on pages 11 and 111. He passed away late last year at the ripe old age of 98. Not only was he the illustrious founder of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, but he left me and everybody on the planet a rich legacy of seasonal patterns, strategies and indicators. Many of which he discovered, invented or devised. He also brought others to light with clarity and always full credit of course. And most importantly, from the first Almanacin 1968 Yale taught us all how to think differently about the markets and recurring market patterns. Thanks to him we have a plethora of tools in our analytical and statistical arsenal.\n\n&gt; To quote the great Sir Isaac Newton, \u201cIf I have seen further, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.\u201d We proudly stood on Yale\u2019s giant shoulders when we created our \u201cJanuary Indicator Trifecta\u201d back in January 2013. Which brings us to the present.\n\n&gt; Combining our three January indicators, the Santa Claus Rally (SCR), First Five Days (FFD) and January Barometer (JB), into the \u201cJanuary Trifecta\u201d has proven to be an especially reliable gauge for future market performance. When all three are positive, as was the case in 2019, the next eleven months have been up 87.1% of the time with an average gain of 12.3% and the full year advanced 90.3% of the time with an average S&amp;P 500 gain of 17.5%. The worst full-year decline in a year with a positive January Trifecta was 13.1% by S&amp;P 500 in 1966.\n\n&gt; With less than two hours left in the First Five Days, S&amp;P 500 will need to gain more than 70.13 points (1.49%) by the close to keep the bullish January Indicator Trifecta alive in 2022. Since the odds of that happening are slim at this juncture that leaves three possible scenarios for our \u201cJanuary Indicator Trifecta:\u201d SCR up and both FFD and JB down (8 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 2\/down 6, average -5.8%, full year up 1\/down 7 average -9.4%); SCR up, FFD up and JB down (12 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 10\/down 2, average 9.9%, full year up 9\/down 3 average 6.0%); or SCR up, FFD down and JB up (6 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 5\/down 1, average 9.7%, full year up 5\/down 1 average 11.8%). So, two out of three ain\u2019t bad. (See the tables below.)\n\n&gt; Wednesday\u2019s market decline was triggered by a much more hawkish Fed perception following the release of last month\u2019s FOMC Meeting minutes. A more aggressive removal of Fed liquidity could aid in pulling back inflation and it could pressure stocks as bond yields rise. We will withhold final judgement until the final results of the January Barometer arrive. Our base case scenario from our 2022 Annual Forecast is still our pick at this juncture.\n\n&gt; As the opening of the New Year, January is host to many important events, indicators and recurring market patterns. U.S. Presidents are inaugurated and usually present State of the Union Addresses. New Congresses convene. Financial analysts release annual forecasts. Residents of earth return to work and school en masse after holiday celebrations. On January\u2019s second trading day, the results of the official Santa Claus Rally are known and on the fifth trading day the First Five Days \u201cEarly Warning\u201d system sounds off, but it is the whole-month gain or loss of the S&amp;P 500 that triggers our January Barometer.\n\n&gt; As defined in the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is the propensity for the S&amp;P 500 to rally the last five trading days of December and the first two of January an average of 1.3% since 1950. The lack of a rally can be a preliminary indicator of tough times to come. This was certainly the case in 2008 and 2000. A 4.0% decline in 2000 foreshadowed the bursting of the tech bubble and a 2.5% loss in 2008 preceded the second worst bear market in history.\n\n&gt; The January Barometer (JB) has registered 12 major errors since 1950 for an 83.3% accuracy ratio. Including the eight flat years yields a .722 batting average. Over the years there has been much debate regarding the efficacy of our January Barometer.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/b8f93f60fe5cf29b17c5339e7751ea96\/f382de5b7397e50b-a3\/s500x750\/5820cb6ed4e55c135c4f2d016b1ae521c085380e.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # January Almanac: Typical January Weaker Last 21 Years\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/0db7be701e8b12ea99121a7d8ee4058c\/472f14a607c3f433-51\/s500x750\/3f1ad549d35e5c06e7ff3855881152a43e468520.jpg))**\n\n&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.\n\n&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. The early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic spoiled January in 2020 &amp; 2021 as DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 declined.\n\n&gt; As you can see in the chart above of the Typical January Performance over the last 21 years diverging market performance across the major indexes like we saw today is not unusual behavior during January in recent years. Since 2001, the S&amp;P 500, DJIA, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all declined eleven times in twenty-one years in January. DJIA and S&amp;P have posted minor average losses while R1K and R2K have posted fractional gains.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain of 1.0% up 12 of 21. All started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the end of the month. Weakness has historically accelerated just after mid-month, around the eleventh trading day.\n\n&gt; In midterm years, January ranks near the bottom since 1950. Large-caps have been the worst with S&amp;P 500 ranking #10 (third worst) with DJIA and Russell 1000 ranking #9. Technology and small-cap shares fare slightly better in the rankings, but small-cap average performance is still negative and NASDAQ is only barely positive.\n\n&gt; On pages 112 and 114 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2022 we illustrate that the January Effect, where small caps begin to outperform large caps, actually tends to start in mid-December. Early signs of the January Effect can be seen when comparing iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) to SPDR S&amp;P 500 (SPY) since around December 15. Historically, the majority of small-cap outperformance is normally done by mid-February, but strength can last until mid-May when indices typically reach a seasonal high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/264d17cd704aa1ed514e351b39b3555c\/472f14a607c3f433-f3\/s400x600\/90e55babc982062d337de902346311e86e1b9353.jpg))**\n\n***** \n\n&gt; # ARK Innovation (ARKK) Now Underperforming QQQ Since the Pre-COVID Peak\n\n&gt; After further declines to start 2022, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is now up just 47.3% since the pre-COVID peak for the US equity market on 2\/19\/20 and is now only beating the S&amp;P 500 by 6.66 percentage points since the pre-COVID high. Not only that, but it's also underperforming the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) by 17.9 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ARKK was the envy of the industry in the year or so after the pandemic hit. Fund assets for the ARKK ETF went from $2.4 billion prior to COVID up to $28.5 billion at its peak last February. At its high, ARKK was absolutely crushing both SPY and QQQ. On 2\/12\/21, ARKK was outperforming SPY by 143 percentage points since the 2\/19\/20 pre-COVID peak for the stock market and beating the more tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 by 117 percentage points. Since its peak, ARKK has dropped more than 43%, allowing the more steady SPY and QQQ to catch up. Talk about a real-life \"tortoise and the hare\" scenario!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2022\/01\/arkkspyqqq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2022\/01\/arkkspyspread.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2022\/01\/arkkqqqspread.png))**\n\n&gt; Interestingly, if we look at ARKK's annualized price change from its launch in October 2014 through the pre-COVID peak for the stock market on 2\/19\/20, it's roughly the same as ARKK's annualized price change since the 2\/19\/20 pre-COVID peak: ~22.8%. Also, throughout its history, ARKK's annualized total return still stands at ~24.3%, which is nearly 10 percentage points better than SPY's annualized total return of 14.8% over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2022\/01\/arkkprice.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # IPO Death Cross\n\n&gt; The past two years have seen an explosion in new equity issuance in terms of the number of deals, and especially in terms of the dollar value of those deals. According to Bloomberg data, US average monthly issuance has been $23.83 billion over the past year. That is well above any point in the past few decades including the late 1990s. The actual number of stocks hitting the market has also set records this year, surpassing the 1990s peak.\n\n&gt; While there has been a huge slug of new issuance, the performance of these names have been lackluster. The Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) does not necessarily track every new name to hit the market, but it does act as a reasonably good proxy for the space. IPO reached an all-time high early in the year in February, but since then it has generally been rangebound fluctuating around its moving averages. Since the fall, and particularly in the past month and a half, the ETF has taken a significant leg lower. IPO has now fallen over 18% since the October 25th closing high, taking out its moving averages in the process. Today, IPO is setting up for what is typically viewed as a negative technical pattern: the death cross (when a downward sloping 50-DMA falls below a downward sloping 200-DMA).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/122921-IPO-1.png))**\n\n&gt; IPO does not have an extremely extensive history only going back to October 2013, and as such, there is only a small handful of prior examples of other death crosses without another instance in the prior three months. In the table below, we show those past instances. Albeit there is a small sample size, contrary to the name and pattern's reputation, prior death crosses have generally been followed by decent performance going forward.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/122921-IPO-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Santa Came To Town And 5 More Charts To Watch\n\n&gt; Here is one chart about Santa and five more charts (or tables) that caught our attention recently.\n\n&gt; Well, stocks did what they were supposed to do, which was gain during the historically bullish Santa Claus Rally (last 5 days of the year and first 2 days of the following year). We discussed this seasonally bullish period here, but the bottom line is we expected these days to be strong. It is when Santa doesn\u2019t come to town that makes us worry. In fact, three of the past four times he didn\u2019t come (2000, 2008, and 2015) saw stocks fall for the full year and the last five times he didn\u2019t show all saw January lower. Only 2016 avoided a drop for the full year when Santa didn\u2019t show, but that year started off with one of the worst first six weeks ever, so Santa was still a warning sign.\n\n&gt; Mark this off as one less thing to worry about in 2022.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/lplresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/blog-1.5.22-1-.png))**\n\n&gt; Just because stocks were up big last year by itself isn\u2019t a reason to worry. \u201cThe truth is big yearly gains likely take place in larger bull markets, so don\u2019t get a fear of heights just because of what happened in 2021,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, the past seven times the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 25% saw the next year higher, with five of those years up double digits.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, the S&amp;P 500 is up nearly 12% on average and higher 86% of the time after it is up 25% the year before. There are lots of worries out there, but \u2018stocks being up a lot and that is why I\u2019m bearish\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be one of them.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/lplresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Blog-1.5.22-2-.png))**\n\n&gt; The first day of 2022 started off with a rare all-time high on Day 1. We were surprised, as this has only happened five other times in history. Let\u2019s be clear, we would never suggest investing based on one day, but years that make a new high on the first day actually see a strong January and strong full year return. Not to mention nearly 40 all-time highs on average along the way.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/lplresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/blog-1.5.22-3-.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking this a step further, stocks not only made new highs, but it was a strong Day 1 as well. Below you will see that previous times the first day of the year gained more than 0.6% saw stronger than average January and full year returns. Again, don\u2019t blindly invest on only this one signal, but it is quite interesting.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/lplresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/blog-1.5.22-4-.png))**\n\n&gt; The fourth quarter of 2021 went out like a champ, gaining more than 10% in the process. Turns out, 10% gains likely mean continued strength. Incredibly, the S&amp;P 500 was higher two quarters later the past 12 times the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 10% in a quarter.

Turns out that future strength is more common than you might think. Two quarters later the S&amp;P 500 has never been lower and a year later up a very solid 14.1% on average. In fact, you have to go back to the early 1950s for the last time a quarterly win streak ended at 7, as they usually manage to go further than most think.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/lplresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/blog-1.5.22-6-.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 7th, 2022** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e4fBYhLZaUQ))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.9.22**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$TLRY $JPM $C $DAL $WFC $CMC $TSM $BLK $AZZ $KBH $SNX $ACI $JEF $FRC $ACCD $OGI $SJR $WIT $LMNR $VOLT $WAFD $BBCP $ETWO $INFY $GHG**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/A3JLkrA.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hYnEelq.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date\/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.10.22 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FJLZDx6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.10.22 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nRelhdf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.11.22 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Ab6wXAP.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.11.22 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.12.22 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OWc7ZWE.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.12.22 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/umM7wxg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.13.22 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UIjkF4F.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.13.22 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bAVcbcL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.14.22 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/asqYgqS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.14.22 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tilray, Inc. $6.42\n&gt; **Tilray, Inc.

I think the S&amp;P 500 is too loaded with Nasdaq-100 companies to have an appreciable divergence... but the DJIA only has 6 of its 30 companies in the Nasdaq-100."}

Im up like x20 in total but maybe the most important thing are the bnb rewards. Its...insane, what else can I say. Since day 1 (its day 6 now) I have claimed almost 11bnb in rewards. They are sent automatically to my wallet approx every hour, sometimes when volume is low ot sends every 2 hours. I woke up this morning after a few hours sleep and even when we got a dip right now, I earned 0.3bnb which was added to my wallet this night. Now 2 hours later, another 0.1bnb dropped in. You see where Im getting?\n\nGuys, all I want to say is that this WILL be your most secure and profitable investment of 2021. Especially if you buy now. You can wait a few weeks, but it will just be more expensive. \n\nAnd while you invest, make sure to at least buy 10 000 tiki tokens, to be eligible for bnb rewards. Preferably buy more if you can. The more you invest, the more bnb rewards every hour. \n\nIts a no-brainer. Genius project. The people who hold for another 2 months and more will be the huge winners."}

{"question":"I hope the story of Whale Teeth inspires you to HOLD onto your dreams! Let me tell you a little story that I hope will inspire the shit out of you to HOLD onto your dreams. 28 days ago I made my first whale teeth meme (fig 1). It was a dumb meme that didn't make sense, it got 66 upvotes and was only 83% upvoted, but it awakened something within me that I wanted to explore. I wanted to take this format further and share it with the world!\n\n[fig. 1](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/t7rztxx5v6j71.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac61f9d18ba31844f76ea63704644f34239331c)\n\n27 days ago I made a flurry of whale teeth memes posted to r\/Superstonk \\- initially I tried my best to make them GME related but they just kept coming out, a whirlwind of shitposts and nonsense that the mods couldn't keep up with. I got a lot of hate, people downvoted them and called me a shill and forum slider. I don't know what kept me going, but against all odds **I HELD ONTO WHALE TEETH FOR THE LIFE OF ME.** I made whale teeth memes late into the night until my eyes bled and carpal tunnel syndrome become too great to continue.\n\nI posted and posted and got slaughtered with downvotes, negative comments, people made fun of me, blocked me, called me annoying, I got temp banned, but I knew some day whale teeth memes would shine like I believed they could (fig. 2 &amp; fig. 3).\n\n[fig 2.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ot7zpmdyv6j71.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c023b5c1a28e90aac3ebdf6e0ca7aea8cb75027e)\n\n[fig. 3](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5kug52o4w6j71.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b348a9f7d189e3d6b97ee62938649f7d35162923)\n\nBut it wasn't all negative - I made some incredible friends along the way, they supported me and told me to keep doing what I was doing. They kept me together when I was at my lowest, I truly can say I survived only because of them. Together we made whale teeth memes and we shared the joy, it was truly the best of times. I learned to make my own videos and \"Whale Teeth for MOASS!\" was born (fig. 4).\n\n[fig. 4](https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/pad15a\/video\/vghsg3y4b7j71\/player)\n\nThen, against all odds, a certain pickle-VWAP-praising-streamer discovered the way of the whale teeth.

{"question":"This market is not irrational, it is anti-rational. At the beginning of August the market started rallying in anticipation of more stimulus. Every day, higher and higher and higher. Then, the talks fall apart and we dont get the stimulus! Should have been huge news that took the market back down to at least beginning of August levels. But nope, this retarded market wants to stay at all time highs instead.\n\nTuesday, Walmart reminds us that the only reason they did so well is because of the stimulus and business has slowed since it ran out. This trend is likely true for the entire recovery. The market modestly punished wmt for a day but mostly brushes it off.\n\nWednesday the Fed does not say anything supporting the yield control that these crazy bulls keep talking about, they also remind us that the economy is not good and we need stimulus. Futures look bad that night but by the next day the market only falls a little, like a percent, then goes right back up by end of day Friday. All of this on historically low volume.\n\nApple, already at ATHs, up another 5+% today on nothing. TSLA has a P\/E over 1000. Thats right **over 1000!** Say what you want about p\/e not being important but when it gets to these levels it matters. Its like people expect teslas to be in everyones driveway within 5 years. Like gas cars will disappear and Toyota, GM, and VW are entirely are incapable of making an EV. It is retarded.\n\nMeanwhile, Footlocker has very impressive earnings, reinstates their dividend, and it goes up only 1 percent. How does that make any sense? \n\nHow long can the idiots run this market? It has become spiteful to reality. Its just, take what makes sense and do the exact opposite. Seriously wtf is happening? Its not just the fed, there has to be some serious manipulation going on behind the scenes. If we're going to say its inflation, then why is gold continuing to fall?

I have 55k in savings. 10k in a personal stock account. 10k in 401k. Roughly 10k in equipment from a previous business I will be selling. I also have a truck worth about 20k that I could downgrade on. \n\nI want to know if it would be a better idea to pay off my mortgage (could have it paid off in a year). Or to just pay the minimum and star dumping cash into the market. The mortgage is at 3.6%","answer":"I'd always recommend maxing out a 401k first and as a recent retiree I'm seeing the benefit of that now.  I'm also a huge fan of being debt free so I'd say max your 401k then pour then rest into paying off the house.  Leave taxable savings for after the house is paid off, assuming you already have an emergency fund.  It sounds like you have a good income in relation to your expenses so you'll be pleasantly surprised how fast your savings grow once your house is paid off and you're investing that payment instead.\n\nRemember that the stock market tends to grow in the long term, but can crash hard in the short term.  My wife and I paid off our house just before the 2008 market crash.  The company I worked for went through bankruptcy and was letting people go left and right.  I can tell you that there was huge comfort in knowing that no matter what I had a roof over my head.  Imagine the stress of being unemployed in 2008 and having to make a mortgage payment on top of all your other bills.  Once your emergency fund ran out you'd be locking in the 38% loss the market took in 2008 if you had to sell to make payments."}

{"question":"Why are people not using moving average strategies more extensively I'm somewhat of a beginner in algotrading and technical analysis etc. But I've been looking at bitcoin charts and long \/ short term exponential moving averages.\n\nI've found that for any period in bitcoin pricing history I would make a profit by buying when the short term EMA passes the long term EMA, and selling when the short term EMA passes below the long term EMA. (yes, I've taken into account the cost of buying and selling bitcoin)\n\nAn example is this: if I were to have bought \/ sold bitcoin using this strategy on the kraken EURO market since the 8th of July. I would have made a 42 euro profit if I bought 1 bitcoin. That is a 7.35% ROI for a month.

You'll have other seasons where things are active and moves are based off the 5 and 15 - by the time the 20 and 60 cross, the move is already over.\n\nI eventually abandoned MA strategies because I moved towards more machine-learning \/ statistics-based techniques, and because I couldn't reliably detect a seasonality shift with the MAs.\n\nIf you can account for the seasonality shift, then the strategy can work.\n\nNote: MA periods chosen arbitrarily."}
{"question":"Why the Amazing Accuracy of Fibonacci is Totally Misused Actually Causing Losses if Not Used With This Knowledge. I have to admit that I spent a long time trying to figure this out about the whole concept of how to trade *and* how Fibonacci works in trading. I have seen some fairly famous gurus, some saying Fibonacci is the key to trading and some saying it doesn\u2019t even work at all. When I discovered what *does* really work, then at least I now understand the role of Fibonacci and what it really shows you for identifying the probability of entries and exits.. You can see this for yourself and prove that it's true about all financial markets in general.\n\nMany traders can get overly fascinated with Fibonacci to the point that they start believing that it is a trading strategy or would be the reason for *whether* there is an entry for a trade while not really being aware of the real reason.\n\nYet many times it is spot on and looks like a perfectly precision clockwork machine. So how do you know?\n\nYes, Fibonacci has some relevance, not to support and resistance zones, per se, but for identifying ends of corrections to trends. Or for projecting wave targets. It can have some amazing accuracy but can also be a total distraction from understanding the *real* reasons for entering trades.\n\nOk so how do you use Fibonacci?   And why do so many traders look at a chart and say such ridiculous things like, I\u2019m going long at 61.8 or some other completely meaningless irrelevant nonsense?\n\nDoesn\u2019t it make sense that in order to use Fibonacci you would need to read chart patterns first using basic understanding of what trends are and what corrections are with some reference to Elliott Wave before it is useful to measure anything?   Otherwise you will see people measuring things that have no relevance and should not be measured.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iauxdopazgv61.png?width=626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd49958c975364cbe1071f0777f49b0bc43cd29f\n\nSo if there is a value to Fibonacci it would be from measuring certain types of patterns relative to certain other types.  Measuring a movement down relative to a movement up could be a mistake.   If for instance there was an end of a correction and someone started measuring the next movement relative to that it would be useless because a trader who knows this would know the price would go past 100% and keep on going.\n\nThe next step would be to notice that when there is an end of correction for one currency pair or other equity, there will be a similar end of correction on several others at the exact same time.\n\nHere you can see that on the EUR AUD the end of this correction seems to have turned right at 78%.   Amazing!  But why not 61.8% or 50% or 38%?  Should we sell at each of those levels and see what happens?  Is there a way to know which level it will turn at?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9bbww0lhzgv61.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f024ee0990229cd88d2484f61a0d382e66114101\n\nBut with the almost exactly inversely correlated AUD CHF pair this one made the exact same turn but at a level that is as far from a Fibonacci level as is possible.  Therefore is Fibonacci the reason for the entry?\n\nOn gold, XAU USD the near perfect turn formed at a level that is as far from a fibonacci level as is possible.  How is it then that we identified that turn right on the dot and got in right at the very point?   How can you know how to enter a trade if it is not because of the Fibonacci level?  The obvious answer is because of identifying the end of a correction which is not done by fibonacci.  Fib levels can give 5-10 Points on the probability rating scale but the pattern itself has a much higher rating on that scale. So these turns can easily be identified and many times I check the fibonacci level AFTER entering the trade not IN ORDER to enter the trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vzmq03jnzgv61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10102fa83351a241c733490f2b91b1278149e6a1\n\nYet, on XAU GBP there is a 38% level hit right on the mark for an entire 5 wave pattern and 78% hit for the last wave by itself.  Amazing! But is that the reason it\u2019s an entry?\n\nWhen you see what really shows whether or not there is an entry and the reason it is an entry or not, then the whole question of whether or not Fibonacci works will sound like whether or not a measuring tape works in building houses. Yes a measuring tape works to assist with building a house but if you go to a construction site and start measuring things thinking you are building a house you could be missing something else.\n\nI went to numerous seminars on using Fibonacci in trading and took enough courses to fill a closet. And now if a trade forms I see it and the turn might happen at a Fibonacci level or it might be as far away from a level as possible. I was recently at a popular Forex trading seminar in my area where a famous guru gives a big presentation that leads to the conclusion that the participant should buy his product. So one of the reasons given is that he tried using Fibonacci and harmonic patterns and his teacher told him to enter at a certain level and the market did not turn. Then he was told to enter at the next level and it did not turn there either. So another level was guaranteed to be the turn and as you might guess he lost so much money it was devastating.\n\nThe phenomenon described is one that I am familiar with and I know exactly why it happens. The reason requires learning a new way of trading altogether but to sum it up, if there was an end of a trend on a longer time frame such as the daily and then the trader goes to a shorter time frame like the 1 hour without realizing the market turned, it can look exactly like a correction but it will keep stretching and never stop. This phenomenon has caused people I know and respect to lose so much capital that their accounts are nearly wiped out.\n\nThe reason is because Fibonacci seems to be mathematical and gives trading a sense of being a technical activity.\n\nTraders feel like they have these lines on their charts and are measuring things and that makes it look like they engaged in some kind of engineering work. And yet the reason for entry has very little to do with those lines or measuring anything.\n\nWhen an entry forms what is the real reason for it being an entry? Is it because the price went to a Fibonacci level? Why that level? Why not another level? The whole retracement level is covered with levels and when the market turns it is often at a level that is in the exact center of the levels or at a place that is totally random and not related to Fibonacci.\n\nThis brings me back to the way to use Fibonacci. So many traders I have known have been trained by some guru like Joe DeNapoli or maybe through a Youtube channel. One seminar I attended called it the Jedi Forex Method and showed some Fibonacci strategies used by another famous trading mentor. And the truth is it can be fascinating and seem powerful.\n\nNotice in the chart above how the market forms a correction in a downtrend on the US Dollar index and hit the 61.8 % retracement level turning like a natural precision clockwork machine. But what about all the other times when it doesn\u2019t turn at that level of it doesn\u2019t turn at any level? Why do traders put some much emphasis on something that is totally hit and miss and actually has little to do with whether there is a winning trade? It\u2019s the same reason for most of the mistakes made in trading. Trading technical knowledge is fascinating and traders make the mistake of believing that this means it has a meaning in trading becoming the reason for entering. So many of these \u201cfascinating\u201d phenomena are almost irrelevant to the actual reason for entering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bsjh4y2xzgv61.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e8445b17a1e59a660a620bc1d1f6ce11336398b\n\nHere is one way to prove that. Look at a group of correlated pairs. Such as for the U.S. dollar you can look at the Dow Jones U.S. Dollar Index, the DXY U.S. Dollar Index, the EUR USD, and the USD CHF. Or you could take some of my favorites, the AUD CHF, EUR AUD, NZD CHF and EUR NZD. The next time there is an end of correction measure all of them. Notice that one of two might be at Fibonacci levels and the others are not. So are the levels the reason for seeing the entry? If so, you can\u2019t see or know there is an entry on the rest of them?\n\nIn this chart, you can see first that there is a perfectly shaped and proportioned trend that is highlighted. This happens to be from today with the Dow Jones U.S. Dollar index which has no weighting like the DXY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f5sgkax20hv61.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e04ab8a190b75df316bb4868e0081b21f812eeb\n\nSo the reason I identified this entry right smack on the dot and do that on a regular basis is not because of the Fibonacci. It\u2019s because of being able to easily read and recognize 2 distinct shapes which serve as \u201cletters\u201d of the \u201calphabet\u201d in the \u201clanguage\u201d of financial markets. It\u2019s unfortunate that few people can read this, and yet it\u2019s very obvious with no special skill needed.\n\nIf children can learn to read letters like \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d in the first grade and then learn the meanings these shapes have using the to spell words that form sentences, then adult traders naturally have the skill to learn to read financial markets IF they are not conditioned by useless training and strategies, to NOT see these and put focus on things that are not related to that.\n\nFor me, I can see it every day and other people can see it. Many people know that it is true that markets form these and by observation can know the high probability that they continue to repeat over and over.\n\nIf you have a group of correlated pairs and at some point they all turn, forming the end of corrections often similarly on each one. Some are at Fibonacci levels and some are not. Yet, the reason to enter can be obvious on all of them, leading anyone to know that the reason is not because of Fibonacci or a certain expected level. One you know what the reason is you can keep using Fibonacci without believing it is the reason for entering.\n\nThis is just the beginning of the story and if you want to learn more join in our live trading sessions and see these entries forming every day in real time.

Georgy boy is already in the CEO position why is he on the nominations list? this means that there are a few options with this.\n\nA) He wants to remain CEO and can only do so by vote\n\nB) he wants to be CEO but the rest does not, so they have to put it to a vote\n\nC) he is willfully stepping down from the CEO position, but he would like to stay on board.\n\nD) this is just a way for him to gracefully step down?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTldr; our boy is Chairman of the board, but can also become the ceo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there is more good news in that respect, remember earlier in the week GME put out a statement saying they could issue about 3.5 million shares extra and people lost their shit, but if you read the filings from yesterday you'd know that the new board will be paid in shares.\n\nso how is this good?\n\n**BECAUSE THE BETTER THEY MAKE THE COMPANY THE MORE THEY GET PAID!**\n\nthis means if they do a shit job they get shit pay, they make the company the next amazon these guys get more bang for their stock, this is as bullish as it gets.\n\nRC came out of the gate and said, nah pay me in shares instead of normal wages, this not only shows commitment but also is a direct incentive to perform and not just for him no the entire board!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9pnfh9xva4s61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b50e29903ef2bbc858e94b4d020fbe5a7c632f21\n\n[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/gamestop-announces-slate-director-candidates-110500597.html](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/gamestop-announces-slate-director-candidates-110500597.html)\n\nAlso because people seem confused by this in the 8k let me try and explain.\n\nBEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING DECISION, THE COMPANY\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT(S) IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS TO BE FILED WITH THE SEC IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S 2021 ANNUAL MEETING OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THE PROXY STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S 2021 ANNUAL MEETING AND THE PARTIES RELATED THERETO.\n\nThe entire \"we can vote\" thing will be pertinent to those statements, we are still waiting for those statements to be released, we don't know as of right now when they will be coming out, could be today or next week for all we know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fecznxze84s61.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f1e79414a3aaabe8c723c4d9819fd70d48279ab\n\nFor the new apes, I've seen some things pop up like \"this is good news why is the share price going down?\"\n\nTo you I say, Hi welcome to the shit show we call the US stock market!\n\nFor some weird reason every time we get some good news GME get's hit hard down, this is because if people fomo back in, or the price get's to high the shorts will have to cover (this is called a margin call) and don't expect them to just give up, they will throw everything and the kitchen sink at this to try and prolong the inevitable.\n\nDon't expect all of this to be over in a day or a week, Dr. Burry had to wait for 2 years, but he was alone, we are now in the hundreds of thousands of people all invested in the same company, this has more scrutiny then anything we have seen so far. so be realistic in it's timeframe, it can take days or weeks or months we don't know, it could go any minute for all we know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1o0yn6nac4s61.png?width=639&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87f7014cb61298dc31d1892a63ecfd337d12bc4e\n\n# so onto the 4\/20\n\nu\/mark-five was kind enough to poke me yesterday and I did some checking.\n\nThe date of record is the date they \"count\" your GME as set in stone for how many shares you can vote.

The record date is the date on which shareholders and their holdings are registered with the company. Shareholders who are not listed in the record on the record date cannot vote. Likewise, this applies to loaned out shares. If loaned-out shares are not returned to the original owner by the record date, they do not get voting rights on those shares. 1 share = 1 vote, so this means that however many shares you want to vote you must be in ownership of them on the record date of 4\/20. Not saying that BlackRock, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, etc., will choose to recall their shares, but if they want to, delivery of shares is T+2 which gives a 4\/16 deadline to issue a share recall notice. This also means that any shares purchased on 4\/19 will not increase voting power as they will not be in ownership until 2 days later. After a share recall is issued, any shares not returned T+2 will result in an FTD and could potentially result in a buy-in from my limited understanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've now heard so many conflicting statements so I'll refrain from posting anything regarding the 4\/20 from now on.","answer":"I lack the 100 karma total needed to make an actual post, so I'll try a comment instead. \nHere we go:\n\nR\/Superstonk Will be hit harder - Don't do shit.\n\nTl;Dr If you don't know shit, don't do shit. \n\nMe: \nMasters degree in psychology, good lot of experience in fuckery and manipulation.\nNo need to believe me, just stating is as background to my calculated guess. \n\nCalculated guess: \nR\/Superstonk contains the more impulsive, more prone to action, more reactive bunch of apes when compared to the whole superstonk\/gme\/wsb lot.

{"question":"Does maxing PPF still makes sense? Have been maxing out PPF for its EEE status and also coz of the deductions, now even though the existing tax regime benefits me today, and may benefit me next year too but it is clear that eventually all deductions are going, and also the interest rates of ppf reducing, do you guys still plan to max it or move away from this?","answer":"PPF is an EEE instruments, at 8%+ assured returns and a soverign gurantee it's a no brainer to invest. To top it off, it's tax deferred (so, the money you would have paid in taxes also fetches 8%+ returns every year).\n\nThe kicker is that you can get a loan against PPF at rate + 2% if the need ever arises, so IMHO you should max out your PPF and your future self will thank you later."}
{"question":"Evidence pointing to shorts did not cover pretended they did (via options) to break the squeeze Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing. (This is a re-post, if you previously saw this I would appreciate an upvote for visibility. The previous post got a lot of traction but was removed a mod. I spoke to a mod on the team after and he kindly agreed to approve a re-post.)\n\nTLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, using an illegal method\/loophole to \"cover\" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options. Full version below.\n\nThere\u2019s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https:\/\/tradesmithdaily.com\/investing-strategies\/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation\/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.\n\nThe first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover\/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nFrom TradeSmithDaily:\n\nPlummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out\u2026 Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nThe second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn\u2019t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further \u201cbreaking the squeeze.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\n\nFrom TradeSmithDaily:\n\nThe way the hedge funds could have done this \u2014 made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn\u2019t \u2014 involves trickery in the options market.\n\nThe tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a \u201crisk alert\u201d memo on the topic in August 2013.\n\nThe SEC memo is titled \u201cStrengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.\u201d You can\u00a0[read it here via the SEC website](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/about\/offices\/ocie\/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).\n\nThe memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here\u2019s a quick rundown:\n\n* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.\n* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock \u2014 meaning they are now \u201cshort\u201d the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) \u2014 and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.\n* The shares bought against the call options could be \u201csynthetic\u201d longs \u2014 meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock \u2014 as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.\n* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of \u201cnaked shorting\u201d as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.\n* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn\u2019t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.\n* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have \u201cbought back\u201d their short position via buying long shares \u2014 except they actually haven\u2019t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker\u2019s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.\n\nIt gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they\u2019ve covered their shorts \u2014 even if they haven\u2019t truly covered, and can\u2019t, for lack of available float \u2014 by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.\n\nBelow is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:\n\n***\u201cTrader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer\u2019s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****\u201d**\n\n\\*\\*\n\nIn short (no pun intended) these tricks\u00a0\u201chelp hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren\u2019t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located\u201d. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs\/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https:\/\/wherearetheshares.com\/](https:\/\/wherearetheshares.com\/)) and Michael Burry\u2019s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210130030954\/https:\/\/twitter.com\/michaeljburry?lang=en](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210130030954\/https:\/\/twitter.com\/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.\n\nThese factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren\u2019t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to \u201ccover\u201d short positions they shouldn\u2019t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.\n\nIf this is true, and as explained there are signs that indicate it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority\/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes \"its only a loss when you sell.\" The version for shorts would be \"its only a loss if you close out your short positions.\"\n\nAnother factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ledjwa\/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were\/) and [here](https:\/\/pastebin.com\/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID\/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)\n\nIn addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.\n\nI would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.\n\nIn considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.\n\n**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lcpwh0\/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play\/gm2tsnw\/)\n\n**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/tcr**](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/tcr)\n\nSidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1\/28 Thursday to 113% on 1\/29 Friday) to 55% on 1\/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the \"new\" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2\/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy\/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.\n\nIf you think about GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purpose of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.\n\nThere's an adage oft repeated on WSB that retail investors can stay \"retarded\" longer than funds can stay solvent. The \"paper hand\" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)\n\nAt least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:\n\n* **\"Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.\"** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1\/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.\n* **\"If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.\"** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks ([read this for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lf4vn3\/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just\/), which also supports the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.\n* **\"If his forces are united, separate them\"** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving \"weak-hands\" to sell-off this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some \"paper hands\", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the silver fake news\/manipulation and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.\n\nI will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further.

{"question":"vectorbt - blazingly fast backtesting and interactive data analysis for quants I want to share with you a tool that I was continuously developing during the last couple of months.\n\n[https:\/\/github.com\/polakowo\/vectorbt](https:\/\/github.com\/polakowo\/vectorbt)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a data scientist, when I first started flirting with quant trading, I quickly realized that there is a shortage of Python packages that can actually enable me to iterate over a long list of possible strategies and hyper-parameters quickly. Most open-source backtesting libraries are very evolved in terms of functionality, but simply lack speed. Questions like \"Which strategy is better: X or Y?\" require fast computation and transformation of data. This not only prolongs your lifecycle of designing strategies, but is dangerous after all: limited number of tests is similar to a tunnel vision - it prevents you from seeing the bigger picture and makes you dive into the market blindly.\n\nAfter trying tweaking pandas, multiprocessing, and even evaluating my strategies on a cluster with Spark, I finally found myself using Numba - a Python library that can compile slow Python code to be run at native machine code speed. And since there were no packages in the Python ecosystem that could even closely match the speed of my own backtests, I made [vectorbt](https:\/\/github.com\/polakowo\/vectorbt).\n\nvectorbt combines pandas, NumPy and Numba sauce to obtain orders-of-magnitude speedup over other libraries. It builds upon the idea that each instance of a trading strategy can be represented in a vectorized form, so multiple strategy instances can be packed into a single multi-dimensional array.

{"question":"Being rich is not overwhelming : it will feel good. Beware of FUD. ##The forbidden fruit \u00a0\n  \n*FUD* can take many forms, each more insidious than the last. In general, an effective way to spot it is to pay attention to any information that seems to come up too often, and then to ask yourself: is this real information or is it a rumor? \u00a0\nIf the answer is \"a rumor,\" then I assume it's a potential FUD. If I hesitate, I also conclude that it is a potential FUD. \u00a0\n  \nWhy do I mention this? \u00a0\nBecause since the beginning of our journey, I've been reading regular warnings about wealth and post-MOASS money management. As if it was some kind of forbidden fruit. \u00a0\n  \n*\"70% of people who won the lottery went back to being poor after one year\"* \u00a0\n  \n*\"You will lose friends and family, who will be jealous of your wealth\"* \u00a0\n  \n*\"You will definitely need to hire a financial advisor or you risk losing everything; you don't know how to handle this money\"* \u00a0\n  \n*\"Money doesn\u2019t buy happiness. Your wealth will not make you more satisfied with your life.\u00bb* \u00a0\n  \nOr \u00a0\n  \n*\"The risk of dying murdered or by drug overdose after making a lot of money is very high\"* \u00a0\n  \n\n###This is FUD. \u00a0\n  \nWhy FUD, you may ask? Because all these sentences and recommendations are aimed at one thing: scaring you and making you believe that the solution to what you\u2019re looking for will never be wealth (\"there is nothing to see in wealth, move along!\"). In other words, to keep you away from huge amounts of money. To keep you away from their territory. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n  \n  \n**The dominated participate in their own domination** \u00a0\n\nYou know these sayings. They have become part of our common language, of our expressions and are an integral part of our literary and audio-visual culture: money does not buy happiness. Poor people seem to have a more authentic life, filled with emotions and strong affective relationships. \u00a0\n\nThese sayings are partly there to reassure us of our condition. To soothe our suffering in reassuring and positive autosuggestions. But they are also there to maintain the system in place: the elite uses them to legitimize their condition, to consolidate it. \u00a0\n\nBy conveying these kinds of sayings, people are appeased, making them believe that being in the 1% is not a gift; on the contrary, it is rather a burden. \"Flee, you fools! Wealth is not for you. It is unpleasant, difficult. \u00bb. Do you see how it is made to keep us away from wealth ? \u00a0\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, the people who says these sentences don\u2019t always spread FUD on purpose. They have heard it, believed it so now they repeat it. That's how propaganda works.The poor who repeats that money does not make you happy (to reassure himself), as well as the rich person who repeats it in turn (to legitimize and relieve himself of guilt): both are victims of propaganda. It is a self-justifying system that creates propaganda automatically; a form of auto-FUD. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd thus, please allow me to debunk a few things. \u00a0\n  \n  \n####**Winning large amounts of money is dangerous** \u00a0\n  \nWinning the lottery, in reality, is not associated with an increased risk of death, nor with squandering one's health and wealth. \u00a0\nTheir happiness did not change before and after winning the jackpot (you'll notice it didn't decrease either), but their overall life satisfaction was significantly increased. I don't know about you, but I have a higher regard for satisfaction than happiness. \u00a0\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w24667\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n####**When you win big money, you lose it all a few years later** \u00a0\n  \nThis is a popular saying, backed up by some rare cases. In reality, people who have won the lottery seem to have retained their wealth well beyond 10 years after winning the lottery. Contrary to popular belief, they seem to work less and spend their money wisely. \u00a0\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w24667\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n####**Money does not make you happy** \u00a0\n  \nWhile winning the lottery doesn't seem to increase happiness, studies indicate that wealth is more often associated with increased well-being and happiness in life, including improved health, education, leisure time and security that comes with being rich.

But let me remind you that it was you who decided to invest in GME; it was you who got where you are, not your advisor. That shows you know how to make good financial decisions, or am I wrong? \u00a0\nBut again, it's your decision. Don't hire someone just because some guy on Reddit says you should. Especially if it's going to end up in the hands of an advisor who operates on the fraudulent and corrupt pre-MOASS system.  \n  \n  \n\n###**Bottom line**  \n  \n\nI guess my point is : \u00a0\n- You deserve to be rich and it will feel good!  \n\n- You will be more satisfied with your life  \n\n- You will be more secure, both in your health and in your finances and in life in general. This feeling of security will free up a lot of mental energy that you can spend on your personal development, which should have a direct impact on your happiness  \n\n- You'll be spending more time in the sun sipping Caipirinha; don't forget to wear sunscreen!

{"question":"Gme Infinite gamma squeeze explained Full disclosure, stolen from r\/investing\n\nContext\n\nWhat happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze \\[1\\] and infinite short squeeze \\[2\\]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60. Note:\u00a0A primer on gamma squeeze: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l2t9bf\/gme\\_i\\_think\\_this\\_is\\_a\\_gamma\\_squeeze\\_where\\_dealers\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l2t9bf\/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers\/) Market Maker \\[1\\] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)\n\nMarket Structure\n\nTo summarize the market structure:\n\nFew GME shares to hedge.\n\nHundreds of thousands of are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.\n\nJanuary 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.\n\nConditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze &amp; Infinite Short Squeeze\n\nAs you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM\/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses. Infinite Gamma Squeeze Should\u00a0million of retails buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop\u00a0so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C. There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \\[1\\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily. However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged\/not market neutral.\u00a0If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a\u00a0exponentially worse gamma squeeze, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM\/Citidal. tldr; There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price. Edit1:\u00a0Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit. Example: Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze. What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:\n\nThey scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;\n\nRetails don't all buy the same call options. But given that retail loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.\n\nGME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory. Edit2: For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l2t9bf\/gme\\_i\\_think\\_this\\_is\\_a\\_gamma\\_squeeze\\_where\\_dealers\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l2t9bf\/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers\/) \\[2\\]\u00a0\/r\/stocks\/comments\/l21gpz\/infinite\\_short\\_squeeze\\_explained\\_blue\\_appron\\_case\/ \\[3\\]\u00a0[https:\/\/ca.finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/options?p=GME](https:\/\/ca.finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/options?p=GME)\n\nEdit 2.

My question is - if this money doesn't represent taxes paid or goods exchanged or whatever, what does it even represent? Where does it come from?

{"question":"Did anybody catch the line in the Charles Gradante video explaining why a long hedge fund \/ whale doesn\u2019t just step in and drop half a billion dollars on GME shares + ITM calls to blow up the hedgies? The SEC will step in and stop them. We, retail, are the catalyst to MOASS. This is the #1 piece of FUD I\u2019ve seen for the last 12 months and it\u2019s just been blown to bits. I\u2019ve been all-in on GME since Jan 20, 2021 and every week I see a post or comment either begging for or asking why not has a long whale just come in and blown up the hedgies positions (implying that because it hasn\u2019t happened, the squeeze isn\u2019t real). \n\nIt\u2019s because they\u2019re not allowed to do so by the SEC due to mArKeT mAniPuLaTioN. \n\nCharles Gradante in his awesome tirade explains that retail, since we\u2019re all just individual investors, were (and are) able to just keep buying and buying more shares and calls, which Melvin and other hedgies hedged by buying more shares, hoping the buying would eventually stop, but retail just kept buying more and more as the hedging raised the price more and more, death spiral infinity loop to Oort Cloud. \n\nWe were allowed to do it because the SEC can\u2019t act unilaterally on millions of people simply buying a stock and options on that stock, it\u2019s completely legal and normal market activity. So instead, the market makers, Shitadel especially, used their influence and power to get brokers to turn off the buy button. \n\nThen the SEC and Congressional Finance Committee launched BS investigations that completely avoided talking about the real issues and instead talked about RETAIL needing to be regulated, rather than rightly pointing the finger at the market makers who abuse their privileges to swing the market to their whim and advantage. \n\nSo, at least from all this, we can finally put to bed the FUD idea that the squeeze isn\u2019t going to happen because otherwise long hedge funds would just have blown up the whole situation by now. We now know they\u2019re not allowed to and we simply have to continue holding, buying, DRSing, and also playing smart options (far-dated near the money or in the money calls) because THAT is the exact recipe that led to last year\u2019s sneeze, and will ultimately lead us to the short squeeze. \n\nThis January, the end of **this month**,  we\u2019re heading into the same conditions as last year but with a fraction of the liquidity, which means the price is WAY more volatile on MINISCULE volume. We\u2019re seeing 10% upswings and downswings on less than 5 million volume. Do you not realize how fucking insane this is?\n\nLast year, that 10% price swing would take 50 million volume or more. If you were around last February, you remember that we used to forecast \u201cslow days\u201d by measuring if we got less than a million volume in the FIRST MINUTE OF TRADING. Now we\u2019re lucky to see a million volume by LUNCH some days. \n\n300,000 puts are going to expire this month that the hedgies have been using for a year to manipulate this stock down like sandbags on a hot air balloon. When those expire, the ropes are going to get cut, buying will start in order to roll forward their short positions, but the lack of liquidity is going to cause high price increases on very low volume, leading to a lot of the calls retail is holding going ITM, some of which are going to be exercised leading to more share buying by hedgies, leading to more low-volume price increases, and so on and so forth. \n\nI didn\u2019t intend for this to turn into a rant about all this. The bottom line is, by holding onto our positions and relentlessly increasing the pressure on them this past year by continuing to buy, hold, DRS, and buy far-dated calls, **we are smoking them out**. It is unprecedented that retail has organized (legally) to fuck over this short position and manipulation because a community like this has never existed before sharing in-depth market information and data for months on end. They never thought we would hold past February so they just kept doubling down again and again. \n\nThe longer they wait, the more expensive it becomes for them to delay closing their positions. We are winning ever so slowly and a catalyst from our company will eventually be the match that blows up this powder-keg. \n\nEvery short squeeze ever begins with a major shorting attack to force the price down as much as possible so they can begin to cover for as cheaply as they can to reduce exposure. One day they\u2019re going to fail to reduce that exposure significantly enough and MOASS will begin. I\u2019m jacked to the tits because I believe that \u201cone day\u201d may very well be at the end of this month. Us being at $130 right now is simply the calm before the storm.\n\nEdit: after hours GME go REEEEEE. Feeling pretty good about that last line now.","answer":"On March 10th it seems that someone did take on Shitadel. This was the day of the drop from $340 to $180 ish, which was a premeditated attack as MarketWatch released an article on it before the drop happened. \n\nAfter the drop there was a [**battle between high-frequency trading algorithms**](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/3qM7MI8) where the price kept bouncing between $200-$340. In the end the price stayed low, meaning Shitadel won, that other entity must have bought up millions of GME that day, total volume traded was 71.6M with a closing price of $265. That day alone saw $19B of assets being traded, if the \"good whale\" accounted for only 5% of that volume, then they would have spent $1B fighting Shitadel, which was a futile effort in the end."}

As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.\n    Which is more probable of a person like Linda?\n        Linda is a teacher in elementary school.\n        Linda works in a bookstore and takes yoga classes.\n        Linda is active in the feminist movement.\n        Linda is a psychiatric social worker.\n        Linda is a member of the League of Women Voters.\n        Linda is a bank teller.\n        Linda is an insurance salesperson.\n        Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.\n\n\nI'll wait. \n\nDone? Good.\n\nSo, in this example above when done in more scientific circumstances, people tend to pick Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement as more likely then Linda being a bank teller. [This is wrong. As, if she is a feminist AND a bank teller then she must be a bank teller already (Venn diagram to show visually)](https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.theifod.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/feminist-bankers42edf.png?w=569&amp;ssl=1). People tend to substitute the question 'What description is more probable for Linda' with 'Which description is Linda most similar to'.\n\nHeuristics is the act of substituting a harder question out for an easier one so it is easier to compute.\n\nCalculating probability is hard, similarity is much easier.\n\nNow, lets move this to an example with stocks.\n\nIf I ask you the question, Is your dog stocks project on schedule? You will probably think in your head 'well, is it on schedule now?' which will have a heavy weighting on your final answer. However, your not *really* answering the main question. This is because answering that question is much easier then answering the initial question.\n\nSo, there could be macro conditions that you haven't accounted for. You could just be blindly trusting company announcements which are overly optimistic or you may have not compared where the project is at in comparison to its peers. \n\nDoing all that work is really hard, so we instinctively answer the easier question rather then do proper DD and sit around and think about it (at least I do...).\n\n----\n\nThese heuristics create *psychological biases* that result in error. For the rest of this post I'll go through some examples that were given.\n\n*Base Rate Neglect*\n\nImagine you have a new tech startup that is going to change the game in social media. Every time you whinge about a ticker it will send an email directly to the managing director containing your post, all for the low price of $5 a month. Wow amazing, surely this is the ticket to tendies!\n\nHold up! You should first check what the percentage of subscription tech start ups survive the first year. If that answer is only 10%, maybe this investment isn't as good as it seems.\n\nIt is important to note here that you can still change that prediction based on your classic factors like marco conditions and how well management can sell snake oil. Just make sure you think about this statistically before you fall for the bait.\n\n----\n\n*Availability Heuristic*\n\nOh wow! Look at all these Lithium players that are earning fat stacks. Surely my Malian lithium explorer is also going to succeed. Not necessarily. This bias occurs as more recent events weigh more heavily on our minds. So, if you ask yourself the question 'Am I satisfied with my life as a whole', you may be thinking 'fuck yes I am green as fuck cunts'. This obviously isn't the level of reflection needed to properly answer, have you even considered how you feel about how your wife's boyfriend moving next door?\n\nIn order to get around this, try and think in long term averages instead and ignore that spike of instinct you get in the moment.\n\n----\n\n*Conclusion and Confirmation Bias*\n\nConclusion bias is when someone asks you about the risk of T+2ing a stonk at ATH and you immediately respond 'literally cannot go tits up'. You don't even think about it you just completely jump to a conclusion without gathering evidence.\n\nConfirmation bias is when you do gather the evidence but cherry pick or distort the information to support a conclusion you already support. 'It can't go tits up because they gave us an extra week to get our options!'.\n\nA good way to prevent these is to imagine what would happen if these propositions were invalid with counter arguments. How quickly do you rush to defence saying 'no, my stock is *different*'.\n\n----\n\n*Affect Heuristic*\n\nDo any of you feel oddly bearish on Iron Ore despite doing no research on what is driving the price signals? Almost as if some pork chop has been talking mad shit about earning fuckload of tendies on a certain junior producer that is now correcting?\n\nYour letting your emotions get the better of yourself. Maybe the dip is the best time to buy, maybe your hatred is irrational. This heuristic is simply letting your emotions affect you.\n\n----\n\n*Anchoring Effect*\n\nThe anchoring effect is how an number that someone pulled out of their ass can affect your judgement. This occurs a lot here when someone says something along the lines of \"If this company can score this offtake, their SP should be at LEAST 40c\". Is that true? Fucked if I know but it sure as hell is going to affect how I think about its SP.\n\nIn one experiment just getting a subject to jot down the last two digits of their social security number drastically changed how much they would pay for a bottle of wine. Up to 3 times more for people with the higher number.\n\nWhen you see someone pumping a stock based on a predicted offtake or deal it is really important to critically analyze this as it may be affecting your expectations for the stock which will end bagholding if not met.\n\n----\n\n*Halo Effect*\n\nExcessive Coherence (or Halo Effect in this example) describes how we quickly form coherent impressions and are slow to change them. First impressions count. Lets say your stock's management has done really well for shareholders for the first year of its operations. However, slowly but surely you notice some odd things. S3 Consortium in the top 20 holders, nothing announcements to pump the price and cap raises a month after directors sell off. The halo effect means you are less likely to judge that stock as harshly as that Nickel pump and dump from yesterday. \n\nTo counter this, try and reset your thinking on a stock every now and then. Big announcements are a good opportunity to do so. Try and ignore any intial good will (or bad will) you have and see if it has been performing in the same way it did in the past.\n\n----\n\nSummary:\n\nIf this was too long I think the anchoring effect is the best one to read for the average punter.\n\nHeuristics are shortcuts our brain makes to answer complex questions more quickly and easily. There are patterns to many of these shortcuts which are known to create error. In order do avoid this you have to flip your brain out of instinct mode and into thinking mode. Once you've done that maybe you'll finally be the one selling at ATH rather then holding the bags.","answer":"This ended up way longer then I thought. If you've already cracked open a beer and this is too long, read the section on the anchoring effect and base rate neglect. Imo they are the least known biases that I see called out on this sub, so it might help you when reading through the dailies."}
{"question":"Weekend Update - Are you ready to rumble?? \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 This is a very short update but I have a number of items to cover before market open.\n\n# Welcome Satori Team as Moderators\n\n[\\(plot twist: they are actually IRL androids...\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/htrg11qn55571.jpg?width=630&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df4cdd9ced0faafdb1d70723713e3590447dcd4f)\n\nNot many of you know the true history behind Satori and how it became so intertwined with the mod team. The truth is they've been working with me since before the r\/Superstonk migration. These members include u\/catto_del_fatto, u\/grungromp, and u\/Captain-Fan. They have worked meticulously and tirelessly to progress the Satori project from idea to manifest guardian ape-gel of Superstonk.\n\nAwhile ago, we added u\/catto_del_fatto and he was able to study the sub from a moderator perspective. He has earned our trust and since then has been promoted to general mod permissions. As a result, the Satori team quickly became linked to the mod team, as they became more and more critical to the sub's makeup.\n\nIn the past few months, in addition to Satori, they have helped us identify FUD attacks, organize mod mail, and identify bad actors and true apes alike. I would be wrong to suggest they aren't already a critical aspect of our moderating practice, and therefore we mods voted with overwhelming support to do the next logical step: add them as moderators.\n\n**Please join the mod team in welcoming** u\/grungromp **and** u\/Captain-Fan **to the moderator team.** I have no doubt they will continue to bring incredible concepts to life, with more accuracy and reliability, as mods themselves. Congratulations!\n\nAlso, now they can't escape \\*maniacal laughter\\*\\*cough-cough\\*\n\n# Satori Approvals\n\n[SATORI DIRECTIVE: PR073CC 4P3](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zg5j1yh465571.jpg?width=1332&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6329324faa295c425e8975b0aec1e59b1821e9f)\n\nFor those unaware, Satori is a sophisticated program that we utilize as a subreddit to identify \"true apes\" and also \"bad actors\" or people who would otherwise spread FUD and harassing posts. As a result of this software, we have been able to introduce an approval process that adds members to the Approved Users list. These approved users can bypass the [karma and age limits imposed by automod](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/wiki\/index\/automod_info).\n\nWe realize there is some confusion about Satori, and we are working on clearing this up in a more reliable way. I just created a [wiki page for Satori](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/wiki\/index\/satori) and while it is currently **under construction** you can check back there for updates on the system. This should help us streamline any questions and information, just as we do with [SuperstonkBot](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/wiki\/index\/superstonkbot).\n\nAdditionally, you can check out u\/grungromp's post, [**Satori: The One Week Security Update (Important Information Inside)**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/nva7nh\/satori_the_one_week_security_update_important\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), for a more recent update. The most critical aspect of this post is the new **!apeprove!** comment function, which means that any user, inside karma\/age limits or not, can comment **!apeprove!** on any r\/Superstonk post and be bumped to the top of the list. If your comment is immediately removed, I am told it will still work!\n\nWe have some limits imposed by Reddit, so the approvals are done in waves so as to work within this limits and Reddit policy. This **!apeprove!** function allows active users to essentially cut line. Make sure you use it! Spam will not be tolerated, though. Patience is key.\n\n# We... Us... \"The Movement\"... What is this?\n\n[We just apes.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jcufgqqb75571.jpg?width=760&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06768c4ac97561f9d1e02d46c39aaf6dd120412b)\n\nOkay, listen. We must follow Reddit policy, or they might take the sub down. We must follow actual laws, too, because god-forbid they do something evil like delist GameStop or implicate apes legally, as they did u\/deepfuckingvalue. So, I am going to have to be a bit stern here and amplify a few things that I really think I need to amplify:\n\n1. Please view the DISCLAIMER associated with the subreddit. You can access it by going to r\/Superstonk and (on Desktop) looking at the side bar, and (on Mobile) under the About menu.\n2. We do not manipulate the market. We do not coordinate anything regarding the stock market. We do not urge people to buy or sell, or do anything with what is their privately owned  stock. We do not shame people for their choices as retail investors, in an attempt to get them to hold when they don't want to, or to buy GME when they'd rather buy something else. We let retail investors make their own individual decisions. That's sub policy.\n3. We do not organize or attempt to push political action, or spark Occupy Wall Street 2.0 or whatever some of you think this is. We are not going to organize letters to the SEC or otherwise enter ourselves into a political arena that we, trust me, do not want to enter. We are a bunch of apes who are bananas for GameStop and that's about it.\n4. We are here to share information, build a community, and express ourselves regarding GameStop as not just a stock, but also as a company, in way that is not pressuring or purposefully influential, and is based on fundamentals as well as market realities. If you don't want to talk about GameStop, there are plenty of other subs to go to, and, if you talk about GameStop, make sure you follow the rules and guidelines of the sub.\n5. TL;DR: We like the stock. We love the company. We are apes. That's about it.\n\nPlease also keep in mind that r\/Superstonk was once a small little sub of just under 300 people before it exploded due to the Second Great Ape Migration. After that time, we got quite used to being the unknown sub that everyone needed to know. Well, we kept growing...\n\nWe know that big news stations, personalities and influencers, and likely GameStop themselves all keep track of us, so know that when you post content, it will be seen by people who might be writing negative-slant articles, or who might get on TV and talk negatively about us. I am not going to censor you or limit you, as this community will be as self-aware as it can be, I guess. I am suggesting that you maybe consider how your post or comment will bring unwanted attention or scrutiny to the sub.\n\nNo, I am not asking you to tone it down or \"behave\" for the big shots. Not at all. Have you seen my Twitter? Please. I am just reminding you of where we are. We aren't that little sub anymore. We have more online members than r\/wallstreetbets these days. We are rising fast. Let's just be mindful of what negatives that can bring, if the right apes say the wrong things. I know you are all smooth brains but maybe, if you can spare adding a wrinkle, add one in this regard.\n\n# Superstonk Live: Monkey Business (stay tuned...)\n\n[Created by apes, about apes, for apes.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/oukctkmx65571.png?width=4001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bae7e8fa5859aea36119d68aad01c987b900b15d)\n\nThe mods are currently trying to put together a Monkey Business for the end of this week. The exact date is still in flux, but please comment below if you want to be considered as a participant in these panel-centric live streams, and an organizing mod may reach out to you. You do not need to be on camera, but you WILL need to be an active community member.\n\nWe have only done one episode of Monkey Business and [you can watch it here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/UDKC_oXqhGM).\n\nPlease do NOT contact us directly, and trust that we will reference this post, or select them on our own accord based on behavior and interaction with the community.\n\nKeep an eye out for a post about specifics, or you can subscribe to [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/Superstonk](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/Superstonk) and watch for the stream.\n\n# Superstonk Awards Design Contest (stay tuned...)\n\n[I am giggling right now as I insert this photo.

Therefore, I feel I can be very strict and specific about all of the details \\*evil laughter\\* \\*cough\\* ahem.\n\nWe are going to be hosting a design contest to generate some Community Awards. You can [learn more about these awards here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/announcements\/comments\/chdx1h\/introducing_community_awards\/), but there will be a post early next week (or tomorrow) with all details and submission requirements.\n\nI can say currently that we will be using the bracket system that we used for the Banner Contest, and it will be a bit more streamlined and, well, faster. You will be submitting via email, so please create an anonymous email if you have not already, unless you don't care; I won't reveal anything either way, other than the design, name of award, and author by Reddit username. Also, the top eight will be receiving prizes, and ALL will receive mod-awards that give Premium membership. Stay tuned for more!\n\n*I honestly had hoped to make this post yesterday, but since I was feeling under the weather due to my second COVID-19 shot, there's a slight delay. Apologies! I am giving the other mods time to look at my details and give me feedback before I post, but I wanted to let you all know it's coming.*\n\n# Onward to Market Open\n\n[Make sure you drink lots of water!!! \\(or mead\\\/ale\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2oddk4y585571.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0fb40f1881f57d39f76fedbc348471fd290f129)\n\nI also want to say real quick that the only thing we're pumping right now is my excitement and love for this community and the incredible mod team that I am so very lucky to have at my side. Never, ever, in a billion years, did I ever think r\/Superstonk was going to reach these numbers (over 430,000) or beat r\/wallstreetbets with online users. I mean, I joked about it, like \"Superstonk will be the next big thing! You just wait! I'll show you!\" but really I'm so smooth-brain it hurts so I never expected it for real.\n\nMy joke\/dream was that I wanted to hear Fox News anchors say \"Superstonk\" out loud on national TV, and right now I can't even be sure they haven't already. This is truly remarkable and IMPRESSIVE. To the mods and the entire community, thank you for being the shit a.k.a. the bee's knees a.k.a. diamond-handed lunar apes a.k.a. the kickass OG badasses of reddit. Thank you for being here and making r\/Superstonk the *best sub on reddit*. I am truly and eternally grateful.\n\nI am actually REALLY excited for market open and I have a gut feeling that we're going to see some crazy price action this week. Remember, trust DD over Red's gut... please... Just remember, a lot of what we're seeing is intended to discourage GME holders. If you like the stock, feel free to HODL it as long as you like. I personally will be. Let's go! \ud83d\ude80","answer":"I've moderated a 100-300k subreddit before, and everything I've seen from this team has been incredible and impressive. I have no doubt y'all are doing the best you can to keep this community active, and alive, and true to its purpose: a place where people who like the stock can talk about their favorite stock.\n\nDiamond-fucking-hands, y'all."}
{"question":"Blocsport is the future of blockchain in sports. From handling transfers, scouting, legal, NFT\u2019s and more, $BSC1 is launching tomorrow! In light of recent price movements, it can be difficult to remember how far we\u2019ve come. While the price, of course, is still up considerably from this point last year, the cultural phenomenon of cryptocurrency is still at a peak.\n\nWhile temporary regulatory fears are troubling, they also reflect normalization of the asset class. People as a whole have come to recognize the potential of blockchain and how it\u2019s decentralization clashes with our increasingly centralized world. \n\nOne industry that was **shockingly quick to adopt blockchain and NFT\u2019s was that of sports**. Long a conduit to the average person\u2019s heartbeat, organizations that are designed to seek an edge (and one Dallas Mavericks owner in the Cubes) quickly saw the opportunity in cryptocurrency and have looked to understand it from merchandising to ticketing.\n\nThe next development in this saga begins with **Blocsport, the natural evolution of blockchain in sports** after the massive successes of NBA TopShots and Fan Token Offerings.\n\nThis starts through BlocSport\u2019s ability to employ smart contracts that include a players ID, transfer value, transfer form, confirmation of player movements to and from academy\/club, transfer terms and conditions, and electronic signatures of relevant parties.\n\nWhile this seems like a far reach, considering the many applications of blockchain from handling highly complex loans operating as a bank to upending the entire art market, **handling the transfer of Eden Hazard seems like child\u2019s play.**\n\nYou may be wondering, why would teams need this when they seem to handle transfers just fine? The short answer is that they don\u2019t.\n\nFor one, even big clubs can have trouble tracking down real information about the players that they sign. **From a player\u2019s age to a player\u2019s experience, forgeries happen and facts are misrepresented.** Having immutable information about every player the minute they come into contact with the blockchain would go a long way to securing this data.\n\nPaper contracts are also inconvenient, fallible, and take considerable time to process due to their lack of integration with electronic tools. **For smaller clubs that lack adequate legal resources, this can be a complete nightmare.** \n\nThis extends into scouting as well. With the international nature of sports like baseball, basketball, and soccer, trading information about players can be a process lacking in trust. **Blocsport offers a permissioned system for clubs to trustlessly and reliably trade information.**\n\nFurthermore a decentralized database of players shared directly between sports clubs, a player can register through Blocsport and provide their information to several federations at once.\n\nTheir **Blocsport ID can act as a player passport,** streamlining operations even further and revamping the entire winding web of sports infrastructure depending on several centralized sources into a clean, decentralized system that should **cut down on a wide range of needless costs.**\n\n**Going live on JulPad tomorrow,** **$BSC1 is going to absolutely explode both in the short-term from obvious interest and in the long-term from obvious utility.** By starting with a familiar NFT Marketplace but one that should have exclusive access to athletes, Blocsport is well-positioned to take advantage of trends in the market on its way to **being the next billion-dollar market cap token.**\n\nCheck out JulPad below and make sure you **get a piece of this IDO before more public listings begin!**\n\n[Website](https:\/\/blocsport.one\/)\n\n[Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/blocsport)\n\n[Medium](https:\/\/blocsport1.medium.com\/)\n\n[JulPad](https:\/\/julpad.com\/home)","answer":"The next few years will likely see all sorts of markets becoming tokenised so with that in mind there's a good chance that Blocsport could be the beginning of something huge. \n\nI mean it's even launching right in the midst of the UEFA football championship so the timing is perfect and with first movers advantage it could really pump hard and be a long term hold. Just my opinion tho, DYOR ofc."}
{"question":"How do you mentally compartmentalize your W2 job? WFH has been amazing since it allows me to spend much more time on my own investing.  These days I spend 50-70% of productive hours doing my own research, with the remaining time for the \"day job\".  Obviously, this has had a negative impact on my job performance, even though it's a conscious decision.  I have trouble shaking off the mental anguish that comes from having always been a type A but deliberately putting in less-than-stellar work.  Being surrounded by other high-achieving corporate lifer types doesnt help either.  I often feel guilty about not \"putting in the hours\" and being \"found out\".  It's like I'm trying to smother that inner part of me who's looking for external validation, which has been ingrained throughout my education and upbringing.  I can't quit yet for another 2-3 more years.  \n\nFor those who are fat\/on the path to fatfire and juggle a demanding W2 with a significant non-W2 side gig, how do you deal with the W2, especially from a mental\/emotional perspective?","answer":"I don't have a side gig, but spend time looking at investments along with taking care of kids, etc.\n\nI see you have a case of the Monday morning after the holiday blues.

{"question":"What would be a disciplined way to invest additionally in mutual funds in a falling market? Is there a recommended strategy for investing an additional amount while continuing current SIPs? For eg., if an index falls below 5, 10, or 20% invest x, y, z percent of your current SIPs.  This is to take advantage of the falling market while being disciplined and avoiding emotions to take over.","answer":"For me, I do not generally alter my SIPs, unless there is a catastrophic event (like March 2020). The whole idea of putting in mutual funds is that I do not want to actively keep an eye on things, and stay invested for a long horizon. \n\nOne thing I have done though is spread out my SIPs across the month i.e. I have 15-day installments and one fund invests on 1st of the months, other 5th etc. So there is some money going in roughly every week."}

ABC correction targets ideally 50% of the 12345 impulse, tho on a bigger scale we look to have completed our cycle 4, which targets 38.2% of the 123 (im so so so sorry i know this probably makes no sense, but I promise it all checks out and adds up)\n\nUsing this, lets zoom out and see where our cycle 5 should end up, based on the *assumption* that 264 was our cycle 4 completing:\n\n[specifically look at the white \\\\\"waves,\\\\\" this is our cycle set \\(3rd biggest subdivision of waves in EW speak\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4vs0tr4reb471.png?width=2130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c0bb2c6e801f7ad1b8a219efb183a7b1daf5228)\n\nIdk about you all, but I'm waking up as early as I can and abusing the buy button on my brokerage. this dip won't last long, take advantage of it!\n\nSo lets talk upside price targets now. given that wave 5 targets a 1:1 of wave 1, we can conclude that we should hit AT THE VERY MINIMUM 368 before seeing a strong (ish) correction. Keep in mind, if we crush that target, then we can re assess (granted I'll need to chart out the intermediate waves within the cycle for more precise targets, I'm just too lazy and giving you a basic outlook for the rest of the week.\n\nFor your convenience, should we absolutely crush the 368 targets, watch the levels below for a rejection and show us how strong your diamond hands really are!\n\n[possible cycle 5 targets should we exceed 1:1 extension ratio](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9ccn44j9fb471.png?width=556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5ee1dfb0294be41d1494bf10e726b972352c0d2)\n\nfirst of all, don't you fucking dare day trade. With this roadmap I hope you have a better idea of what to expect going into tomorrow and the rest of this week. I'm ecstatic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor fun, lets zoom out and see for the hell of it what my bigger targets are, for the super cycle and grand super cycle:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[hehe](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lg944b4qfb471.png?width=2636&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=320f403b87ff115f72a15b023a657dd871505c3d)\n\nand keep in mind, this isn't even the squeeze. This is just the calm before storm.\n\nTLDR: BUY DIP. VERY LIKELY 264 was bottom of cycle 4, meaning in ape speak, now we go UP to at least 368.68 in the next few days. if by the off chance that 264 was not the bottom, expect around 238, but no lower (should literally be impossible using EW) than 219. CHEEEEEEEERS!\n\nbuckle up ;)\n\nedit: I see some people saying my \"predictions\" aren't valid because I lay out a few different scenarios. In the market, it's not so much about being 100% certain of an outcome, rather be certain of the possible outcomes and act accordingly. This is why I give all the possible scenarios.\n\nedit 2: today feels eerily similar to the day after march earnings where shorts tried desperately to push price down, we all know what happened the next day...\n\nedit 3: possibly (6) final update for today, looking to have bounced at the 264 level as outlined, I should have mentioned this target in the DD, though it was mentioned in the comments somewhere with another EW ape. keep an eye on 256 as well.\n\nedit 4: lol just for fun, take a look at $IWM, its laughable how desperate they are at this point\n\nedit 5: I set buy orders at 264 and 257, went to the gym and saw we were around 245 and got super excited. Thanks ken, threw the rest of my checking account in and set a buy order at 238 and was super happy to see it filled. The fact that we keep dipping slightly below the 238 level tells me SHF are hunting stop losses, but the fact that they aren't pushing it much farther tells me they're running outta ammo. I really hope you all took advantage of today's fire sale, i got a feeling tomorrow will be like march 25th \ud83d\ude80\n\nedit 6: nooooo hahaha we broke below 219. Lower your pitchforks please lol, I'll draft a new theory tonight. All this means is that i have to redraw my cycle wave set, as we broke the rules of EW today. Just means juicier upside targets, cause this would technically be a cycle \"2.\" Imma need to really wrinkle my brain to redraft this, thanks for putting your faith in my abilities nonetheless :) For what its worth the next bounce candidate i had on watch was 213\n\nedit 7: holy fuck I'm so jacked, wait till you see my new dd... todays price action confirms something huge!!!!! 213 is THE BOTTOM!!!!!\n\nedit 8: lol i love y'all so much i went and gave targets on gangnam style for a few minutes when reddit was down, you found my youtube channel if you were there ;)","answer":"This OP fucks Elliot Waves. I could quibble but there are a lot of overlapping waves on the GME chart because of the fuckery, I have the top of (iii) a little lower, but it won\u2019t matter.

{"question":"[UPDATE] My Mom didn't pay taxes. The State is going to take money from the joint account she opened for me when I was a minor that only I use. Can I do anything? My original post is [here!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/4k66ag\/my_mom_didnt_pay_taxes_the_state_is_going_to_take\/).\n\nAs a reminder, unbeknownst to me, my mom didn't pay her taxes so the bank sent me a notice that the tax board was about to take money from our joint account, which is really my account that she never ever uses, and her name is only on it because it was opened when I was a minor (although I no longer am a minor).\n\nGood news!  I ended up calling the tax board several times, and they were actually extremely helpful once I got a hold of a real live person.  In the end, they had me fax them my information, a pay stub, and 3 bank statements from the last three months, proving that I was the only one who used the account.  Afterwards,  they removed the order to levy my account.\n\nI have since withdrawn the money from that account and put it into my own account.  Problem solved. \n\nThank you for everyone's help and advice on this.  \n\nEDIT: For those who are wondering, my mom will be ok.  I talked to her and convinced her to face her taxes rather than continue to put it off.  She was very very sorry.  She started a payment plan June 1 with the Tax Board.  Whether she follows it and stays with it is up to her. ","answer":"Whew! Though if you haven't shut down the account you might just see if they can take your mom's name off of it. That's what I did with my joint account once I reached 18. It meant not having to redirect my direct deposit and automated bill payment plus it means I still have the original account for history with the bank. "}
{"question":"PPF account can be opened only once in lifetime. How true is this? Hey all,\n\nI read somewhere that PPF account can be opened only once in lifetime.

Can one open another PPF account post maturity?","answer":"The point is- when you get the freedom to transfer PPF account from one bank to another anytime you want, and you only get a limited amount of deduction in 80c, why would could be the incentive behind opening another PPF? \n\nAn individual cannot have more than one PPF account. If you have opened multiple, you can merge them into one."}
{"question":"Getting close to paying off $13k of credit card debt. What next? I was irresponsible after college and got myself into a lot of credit card debt, always thinking I'd get a better job and pay it off eventually. That didn't happen and it snowballed until I could barely afford the minimum payments. I was making less than $30k\/year and I was freaking out because it seemed beyond my control and I didn't know what to do.\n\nThis was a year and a half ago, and I had over $13k all on one card, with 17% APR. I decided to start budgeting and get a card with 0% APR (for a year) and no transfer fee. I paid as much as I could until the year was up, then applied for another 0% APR card and transferred the balance again. That was 6 months ago and I'm down to $4k left on the card now. I plan to have it completely paid off by August, maybe sooner.\n\nI'm starting to feel like a tremendous burden has been lifted and I don't want to screw it up. My credit score is pretty good (749) and I'm now making $35k\/year. I still have $20k in student loans, and I'll be putting any extra money towards that as soon as the credit card is paid off. What should I know going forward? How do I keep my credit score as high as possible?","answer":"I got myself into a similar situation with credit cards in my 20s. You've already done what was the hardest part for me, which is getting in the mindset to take control of your financial life and then maintaining the discipline to follow through on it. \n\nHere's roughly what I did:\n\nPaid off high interest credit cards (~$13K @ 15% interest) with a lower interest personal loan from a credit union (~6% interest)\n\nMade minimum loan payments until I had $1K emergency fund, then dumped all extra money toward loan balance.\n\nOnce the personal loan was paid off (~13 months) I split the extra money between retirement contributions, student loans, and upping my emergency fund.\n\nI also took a  year long break from credit cards (I didn't close my accounts, I just put the cards away) and focused on building a budget that worked for me.\n\nOnce I had my spending locked down and had broken the bad credit card habit I closed all but my oldest account and opened a new card for the reward points. Now I charge almost everything to this card and pay it off monthly.\n\nExtra money now goes into retirement, keeping my emergency fund at about 3 months of expenses, and saving for bigger purchases like a vacation to Europe this fall (credit card reward points help with this too).\n\nAll told, it took me about 4 years to get completely stable. Be patient and diligent and good luck to you. You're already on the right path!\n"}
{"question":"Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang (Minecraft) over 6 years later. It's almost 6 years since Microsoft went through with the acquisition of Mojang (creators of Minecraft) for $2.5 billion. \n\nGamers were pissed and reception to the buyout was mixed. A lot of people have curious as to why Minecraft (an already big game at the time) was worth $2.5 billion. At the time, Minecraft was already insanely popular and was already the most sold PC game of all time. [Annual revenues have shown over $290m](https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/business\/analysis-and-features\/built-last-minecraft-model-9788669.html). So why the gigantic inflation of $2.5 billion?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will spare you the description of Minecraft as the people who don't know what it is will be in the minority. I think it's important to talk about the concept of what Minecraft was at the time of its creation and how that contributed to its mass following. Minecraft's indie aesthetic and open nature almost allowed the players to create a game that they were looking for. Notch (creator) was very active with the Minecraft community and constantly releasing updates and engaging directly with the players ([This ended up having huge personal consequences for him](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140922063257\/http:\/\/notch.net\/2014\/09\/im-leaving-mojang)). Although this concept is not 100% new, it was the first to really become popular. Notch's openness for Youtube Creators to publish content of them playing his game (something that a lot of developers were against at the time) only increased the reception the game had.\n\nIt's common for the video game industry to have games come and go. Hype is a very big thing with video games. So did Microsoft make a $2.5 billion mistake?\n\nAs of now, Minecraft has officially topped at 200 million purchases across all their platforms and over 126 million playing monthly. Prices differ per platform but if counted for all platforms at an average of $15 per copy, we can see roughly around $3,000,000,000 revenue.\n\nOutside of the game itself, Minecraft offers a hosted multiplayer model that will let you play with your friends in a hosted cloud-based world. Merchandise is also a huge source of revenue for Minecraft as well. Spinoffs and installation of almost any device have really put Minecraft everywhere.\n\nIt's easy to be skeptical over acquisitions this large at the time, but in 2020 Microsoft made an incredibly smart move by purchasing Mojang.\n\nThoughts?","answer":"You didn't even touch on all the licensing and merch deals for minecraft stuff. Kids have minecraft swords, nightlights, tshirts and sweatshirts. There's a line of lego sets. They've merch-ed it out like Disney whores."}
{"question":"How I feed 5 people on $200 a week A lot of people are posting about food insecurity. I feed 5 people on $100-$200 (Canadian, so $50-$100 USD) per week. Here\u2019s my tips: \n\n1. Set a budget for each category of groceries. My go-to budget is: \n\n$20-produce \n$20-meat \n$10-dairy \n$10-bread\/cookies\/crackers\n$10-dollar items\/cans \n$30-free (household, spices, special meal supplies etc) \n\n2. Shop each section price first. If beef is cheaper, buy beef. If it\u2019s pork, buy that. \n\n3. Shop daily for at least 2 weeks and at different times a day until you know the store\u2019s stocking and sale schedule. \n\n4. Buy bread from the sale rack. It\u2019s literally 1 day old. Someone in the comments also mentioned noting items that are close to the sell-by date and coming back on that day to buy them. Great advice! \n\n5. Each meal should have 1 starch, 1 veg, and 1 protein. Pork chops, roasted potato and broccoli. Or nachos, salsa, and beans for example. \n\n6. If your family\/housemates\/you tend to overconsume something, stop buying it or buy it on a schedule. They can go ahead and eat 20 granola bars in one night, but you\u2019re not buying any more for a month. \n\n7. Invest in a popcorn popper. Popcorn is a cheap and easy snack that becomes popcorn balls with some $1 marshmallows. Popcorn can also be cooked in any pot by adding a little oil and popping it under a lid. For me, air popping is better because I tend to burn pots with oil in them and the $20 I spent on my popper saves me the cost of oil. A small bottle is $8 right now. But when it was cheaper or if it\u2019s cheaper where you live it\u2019s a great tip! \n\n8. (21+ tip lol) Drink at home and host your friends. A bottle of booze is cheaper than three glasses at the bar\/club. And people will bring more booze as gifts. And they will leave it at your house. Free booze! \n\n9. Shop at a farmers market. The prices tend to be consistent and the produce has a longer shelf life. You can sometimes buy produce by the bushel! From the comments: also check out ethnic markets where the same item can be cheaper. For example black chicken is 6x the price at a specialty market but 1\/4 the price at a Korean market. \n\n\n10. Use up imperfect produce by making sauces and chutneys. Bruised apple apple sauce is so good! \n\n11. Consider having picky children. My friends toddler won\u2019t eat ANYTHING \ud83d\ude02 \n\n12. Don\u2019t do things homemade if they\u2019re cheaper to buy. And don\u2019t buy them if they\u2019re cheaper homemade. You won\u2019t save money making tomato sauce or bread or pie, but you\u2019ll save a ton making your own steak, lasagne, or stew. \n\n13. Look at the per unit price or the by-weight price on the item. For example right now you can get 40 mini chip bags for 9.97 or 18 bags for 6.47. Obviously 40 right? \n\nBut the 18 bags are 28 grams and the 40 are 16 grams. It\u2019s effectively the same amount of chips. \n\nIt\u2019s spooky month so I\u2019m stopping at 13 tips. \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc9cHappy almost Halloween!","answer":"Also, when you shop things with shorter shelf lives, notice the sell by date, especially on the high dollar items. When I see lamb or other expensive cuts with a close date, I will come back the day before and often catch 30-50% off. At my store, the morning crew  does the markdowns, so I pop in on my lunch break and grab what I can."}
{"question":"How does a cost of living crisis historically resolve?

{"question":"ETFs question I have not understood something on how ETFs work, which I cannot seem to find the answer for. I understand the answer could change depending on the ETF, but anyway here is my question.\n\nI understand that by buying 1 ETF (eg. VTI), you buy 1 bundle with small pieces of many stocks. A small piece of Apple, a small piece of Facebook, etc, and finally a small piece of the company X. Let's assume that this company X is removed from the index that VTI is following, so it is removed from VTI. When I buy the ETF again, the new bundle does not include the company X stock. But what about the pieces that I had already bought earlier? Do I still own the small pieces of X stock or the old ETFs that I had bought are automatically updated based on the current composition of VTI? \n\n(Or my question is completely irrelevant because I have misunderstood something basic...?)","answer":"You and 9 your friends give me $100 each in exchange for 1 ETF share. So I have $1000 and I gave you away 10 shares, each one costs roughly $100. Then I buy some shares using those $1000 I got from you. I might distribute the buys using some index (e.g. S&amp;P500) or use my own judgement or even yolo into one company (not really but technically it's possible), that's what makes ETFs different. Anyway, let's say I bought 10 companies and one of them is Apple. You as an investor in my ETF have no Apple shares at all, even the fractional ones, you have a share in my fund, that's it. If Apple grows in value, the value of my fund grows from $1000 to, let's say, $1200, and thus your 1 share of ETF now costs $120. And if I decide to sell Apple and immediately use the money I got to buy Tesla, the value of the fund won't change, your share still costs $120 but it now has no exposure to Apple"}

{"question":"Walk Me Through Closing Without Realtor Hello Reddit,\n\nI have been trying to get financing on a house for 27.5K in the Chicago area for a while. I finally got a small bank that could do the mortgage. I am sending the bank rep the signed purchase contract today but I\u2019m starting to get nervous. \n\nI bought a house a few months ago in a cash deal with just an attorney and no realtor. I am trying to go that route again but obviously it\u2019s different due to financing. \n\nThe seller didn\u2019t want to provide an inspection so I asked the bank rep if it would be okay if I paid for the inspection on my end. In short, he said he couldn\u2019t give advice and recommended using a realtor. \n\nCan someone please tell me all the things I need to do to make sure everything goes well at closing?\n\nThis is what I have so far (I\u2019m drawing on my knowledge from the last transaction). \n\nHome inspection ( will be complete tomorrow)\nSurvey (will be complete Tuesday next week)\nTitle search and insurance (I believe my attorney is handling this but will send email to clarify) \n\nIf I get the three things above done, and ensure I have the necessary cash to close,  am I good to go?","answer":"Is it normal for the seller to provide a home inspection?

{"question":"Were people actually happy for you when they found out you\u2019re richer than they thought? My immediate family were very proud and I guess relieved that they don\u2019t have to worry about me and I\u2019ll be ok if anything happens. \n\nMy friends weren\u2019t happy. (Of course they verbally said they were) I can feel that they\u2019re jealous in the little comments that slip through and they probably think I don\u2019t deserve it. (They have higher academic degrees and has more prestigious jobs, why should I be making\/keeping this much money?)\n\nWhat has been your experience?","answer":"I can kind of speak to this from both sides.\n\nI'm by no means rich but I'm pretty well off for my background and location. Grew up dirt poor, though.\n\nSome people will say \"oh they're just jealous crabs in a bucket,\" and in your case that sounds like it might be the case. People who are overly concerned with prestige and status are the worst for this. It sounds like they have money of their own and are just salty that you happen to have more. That's really shitty.\n\nBut.\n\nIt can be hard to be friends with people who are in a vastly different income bracket than you. Most of my social circle is in the \"working poor\" category. I'm probably upper middle class at this point. The activities you choose, the things you worry about, the rhythm of your life... they're all different.\n\nFrom the perspective of the wealthier party, it gets fucking old having to cover for your less well off friends. Either choosing activities that everyone can afford or being willing to pay for the ones who can't. Limiting your options to try and include the people who were with you before you got money.\n\nFrom the perspective of the less wealthy party, it can feel demeaning. Like you're a burden or a charity case. No one wants to be the person with their hand out all the time. And yes, it can be hard to sit there in a Goodwill outfit driving a 20 year old junker when your friend(s) have all the new and shiny toys. Even if you're genuinely happy for the person, that can sting.\n\nNot saying either of these are 100%, but only my true family (closest friends and blood relatives) were\/are actually happy for me. Most of the rest seem to feel like they're entitled to what I have and viewed me as a meal ticket so I had to cut them out.\n\nAnyway, I've been on both sides of this and just wanted to point out some different perspectives on the subject.\n\nIt sucks, man, but sometimes you have to let those people go to move forward with your own life.\n\nIn your case, sounds like you just need to find some new friends who aren't so hungry for status\/ validation."}
{"question":"PART I - My 10 Minute\/Day Trading Strategy **Before I start providing details, here's a disclaimer:**\n\n\\- YOU are responsible for how you implement this strategy. This is NOT individualized investment advice.\n\n\\- There's a difference between spotting the technical setup and then allocating risk to the trading idea. I have several ways of actually putting money behind this strategy. I will discuss the various ways in a different post. There's no 'best' way. A lot of it will come down to personality and risk tolerance. For example, someone might want the very high win rate and be willing to sacrifice profit factor. Someone else might be okay with a lower strike rate if it means a much higher profit factor.\n\n\\- I teach this strategy to all of my prop traders that are a good fit for this strategy. It seems to work really well for others, not just myself. This is why I am confident in being able to present it to this community.\n\n**Here's a bit of background on the strategy:**\n\nI wanted to have a very easy strategy that I could run on a manual discretionary basis while travelling around the world. This discovery was made several years ago and it is no longer a strategy I run today. The reason I don't run it any longer is because I have since left the retail and prop worlds of trading and the way I run my portfolio now has simply outgrown the strategy. It is a purely technical strategy and does not take news events into account whatsoever.\n\nIt takes 10 minutes roughly each day to look for and execute any suitable trading opportunities. I would guess on average you could end each week with about 3-6 trades taken depending on some discretionary filters (one big one would be which timeframes you want to run the strategy on).\n\n**I have historically run the strategy on the following timeframes:**\n\n\\- Monthly charts\n\n\\- Weekly charts\n\n\\- Daily charts\n\n\\- 12 hour charts\n\n\\- 8 hour charts\n\n\\- 6 hour charts\n\nEvery time a candle\/bar closes you have a potential trading opportunity. This means you know EXACTLY when to be scanning your charts for trades. My favourite way of trading this strategy is on an end-of-day (NY end of day) schedule. So at 5pm EST, wherever I was in the world, I would be at my system looking for setups. Depending on your broker, if the EOD is 5pm EST, then you will be able to scan the D1, 12H, 8H, 6H, 4H timeframes (I personally would only look at the D1, 12H, 8H, 6H timeframes at 5pm EST). You can scan the weekly timeframe at the end of the week. The monthly timeframe at the end of the month. Pretty straightforward.\n\n**Here are the technical elements\/indicators involved:**\n\n\\- Candlestick \/ Bar chart\n\n\\- Bollinger Bands (20 period, 2 standard deviations)\n\n\\- Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3, 3 - standard settings)\n\n\\- OPTIONAL: fibonacci tools (retracements &amp; extensions)\n\nYou should be able to get your chart set up with these indicators no matter what platform you are using. Pretty standard stuff.\n\n**Below is a chart with the main elements of the strategy labelled. Note that this is a textbook short trade example. I'm NOT showing how to enter and exit yet, or even explaining what a great setup looks like. Let's get familiar with just the raw ingredients of the recipe before we start baking a cake, okay?**\n\nAaaand that's a wrap. Part 2 will come shortly. Part 2 will explain the thought process behind the strategy, how it works, WHY it works, WHO this will work for. Part 3+ I will get into the actual mechanics of finding entries and exits. The last \"Part\" will cover how to turn the technical setups into actual trades (aka how do I put money behind this?)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vbrcp3yl25451.png?width=2846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=959868d12c3368355057c7da8cc7c3d5cd588128","answer":"Nice presentation. Looks like a typical bollinger band reversion to the mean with extra confirmation from stochastic. SL is probably some people above the Indecision bar, and tp1 would be the MBB, while tp2 would probably be LBB. Could even be trailing 10-20% after. Works best if higher tf direction is in the same direction as your entry (short if htf is bearish, buy if htf is bullish)"}

{"question":"I love the NFT Marketplace, but please be on guard for those taking advantage of SuperStonk's generosity and hype I love the NFT Marketplace and I think most of the art is pretty damn cool, but please be on guard for those taking advantage of SuperStonk's generosity and hype as I'm seeing more and more AI-generated images which require zero artistry or skill in most cases.\n\nSome of you won't want to hear this, and I fear I'm gonna get downvoted to oblivion... but I would be remiss to not at least throw this out there as more of a 'know what you're buying sort of PSA'. Not going to call anyone out specifically, but there are a number of creators on the NFT Marketplace, some who are making quite a bit money...that are simply using an AI bot called MidJourney to generate art pieces using text prompts. Takes less than a minute to create most of these pieces, and honestly quite a few of the ones I've seen are not really even using the bot very well.\n\nIt's becoming clear to me that a lot of SuperStonk members think they are buying handmade art from these creators, when that couldn't be further from the truth. Now...I'm no hater, if the buyers KNOW what they're buying and realize that these images can be created in less than a minute by AI, then all the more power to everone involved, but based on some of the commentary I've seen, it seems like most apes are not aware that these are AI generated images.\n\nI create AI art myself and it's a lot of fun, but something feels slightly scummy to me that these are being sold for substantial money to an audience who likely doesn't realize how they're actually created.\n\nI can simply go into MidJourney and type a text prompt of \"Imagine\/ Prompt: An portrait of an ape with diamond hands, Norman Rockwell Style\" for example, and within a minute I'll have several pieces of art that can be upscaled and sold as NFT's to any unsuspecting folks who think a digital artist has spent hours creating something manually.\n\nAs a fellow artist and GME holder, it pains me to even bring this up...I'm a huge supporter of artists, but I think more knowledge and transparency are required for this situation. I also don't want others who have most certainly seen this trend, take the GME community for fools seeing that many folks are spending substantial amounts of money for these works. Some folks seem to be more up front that works are created via AI than others, so again...I'm not trying to call out specific creators...just want to educate the community here about how this works, because more wrinkles is never a bad thing.\n\nAs a quick example, I created the following ([https:\/\/imgur.com\/vZBYxUx](https:\/\/imgur.com\/vZBYxUx)) in less than a minute by using a text prompt of \"Ape with a pirate hat, studio portrait\". No additional work at all was done, no photoshop touch up, nothing...just text prompt and receive image.\n\nIf this message doesn't resonate with apes, then feel free to ignore...just don't be surprised if this turns into some drama further down the road once more people catch on to what they're purchasing. And again I want to stress, if I've misread the situation and everyone KNOWS this is what they're buying, than I'll crawl into my corner and shut my mouth.","answer":"One of the better AI artists I saw on the market place sold hand painted works and AI generated along side them using the original work as a seed for the AI. They also labeled the AI generated ones as such and sold them for way cheaper compared to the original works.

{"question":"GameStop NFT Platform + Loopring --&gt; Ethereum L2 Ecosystem COVERED!!! **OPINION &amp; EDUCATION** Hi Fellow Apes \u2013 I am sure you have been hearing a lot about Loopring and their LRC Coin but it may be fuzzy as to how they COULD fit into the picture. I am hoping to help by digging a bit deeper than surface layer exploring. If this looks too long and you want to skip to the Meat, jump down to Ethereum Layer 2 Ecosystem. You will want to read that one.  Also, I like using a single data source and feel that Coin98 does a nice job, by no means is this a plug of their service.  None of this is Financial advise, my black lab is my Financial Advisor.\n\n**Blockchain Platform**\n\nThere are a lot to choose from, but from all indicators it appears GameStop is going with Ethereum. I LOVE this choice, for many reasons, so let\u2019s compare the Top-Tier.\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/twitter.com\\\/Coin98Analytics\\\/status\\\/1437784586642202636?s=20](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/df3tvup1a6x71.jpg?width=1885&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32ed40cf7ad62a4048493331d97b4130b9b85315)\n\nI underlined a few categories that Ethereum blows away the competition. Seriously, just look at Total Value Locked (TVL) \u2013 yes, that is with a B for Billion. The best part, where Ethereum does not have an advantage (say Proof-of-Stake vs. let\u2019s say Binance (BSC), after the MERGE in early 2022 they will have these features. So, not too far in the distance all other advantages will be negated.\n\n**Total Value Locked (TVL)**\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/twitter.com\\\/Coin98Analytics\\\/status\\\/1446445535364194308?s=20](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/szvdebi5a6x71.jpg?width=1802&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71c1f94a91e1ebdb8ce832e2fe8673d2696fe847)\n\n**Total Transactions**\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/twitter.com\\\/Coin98Analytics\\\/status\\\/1453682639672537096?s=20 ++ I added in Red Box &amp; Loopring Logo](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/egs9bal8a6x71.jpg?width=1899&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cda84dbc32a08e429b5a5c6e174df040ff23f9a1)\n\nNot surprising, Ethereum is the 4th popular blockchain platform in this space. One main reason is GAS. With Loopring, that is about to change so do not get stuck here, keep reading \ud83d\ude0a. Oh, if you need a bar chart to make you smile, here is one.\n\n**Total Validators**\n\nWhy are Validators Important \u2013 yeah, they are an essential part of the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, they are essentially the moderators of the staking system and have the EXTREMELY important job of authoring new blocks on the chain. In other words, greatest variety of staking options for the community and protects the system by preventing the chain from being controlled by one very wealthy individual.

Essentially, they increase throughput without tampering with any of the original decentralization or security characteristics that are integral to the original blockchain.\n\nI would NOT be surprised if GameStop uses a combination of Layer 2 Solutions, for example I would be a bit shocked if GameStop did not use Polygon (Mantic in the above) for Gaming.

Thanks everyone. ","answer":"I was in your shoes once, about 12 years ago. Dropped out of college, it wasn't really for me, although I had high SAT scores and generally did well in my HS classes. I just wasn't interested in a liberal arts education. I was working in a restaurant for $9\/hr part time and going nowhere, so I enlisted into the Army.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I could give you some advice: do a short-term contract for your initial enlistment, that way if you don't like it, you can get out relatively quickly. I did a 3 year enlistment, but I think you can still do 2 year contracts in some branches. Also, get in shape beforehand, it will save you some headache once you get to BCT or whatever. Running, pushups, situps, and try to hike a few times with a 35 lb pack at a 4 MPH pace for at least 6-8 miles (up to 15 if you can do it). If you can do those things, your initial training will be so much easier. Don't let them trick you into picking a job you don't want (you'll be miserable) or signing up for a longer contract by enticing you with a bigger enlistment bonus. Here's the kicker with enlistment bonuses (unless they've changed recently): You don't get until after you finish training, and if it's over a certain amount, you don't get a lump sum, it gets broken up into your future paychecks over X number of years. Also, go ahead and figure that you'll lose 25% or more to taxes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome additional advice: if you choose to enlist, be prepared to hate it for a while. I wasn't good at taking orders, wasn't a people person, needed solitude every once in a while, and was stressed out all the time. After my first year, I started liking it. After two years, I liked it a lot more. You gain some rank, get some experience, and people start treating you better, like you know your stuff. Your paychecks get bigger, you get your head on straight, and things start to come together. It's not a bad gig. Let me know if you have questions. I was active duty Army for 3 years, National Guard for an additional 2, and have a couple buddies who are recruiters now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wow, this blew up overnight. Thank you for the gold!

I was recently diagnosed with high-functioning autism (aka Aspergers). My condition expresses itself in many forms, but the relevant part is that I find 99.9% of things absolutely dull and uninteresting. There are only a handful of activities that I can actually get into, and when I do they quickly become unhealthy obsessions rather than hobbies. I'm fortunate that I find my job interesting, and I credit my condition for allowing me to grind hard and long enough to get to where we are. My fear is that leaving the workforce would boith mean losing one of a few interests I have left, and leaving the stability of an enforced cadence for my life.\n\nI'm reaching out to this community to see if there's anyone else out there in a similar position.

{"question":"My employer is suffering from a lack of personnel, can I use this to my advantage and ask for a raise? So, I work in an extremely high volume, and niche manufacturing plant and I work on a 4 man team. We work in a lab that runs in an assembly line type of fashion. When we are down a man we suffer, but can make do. Currently we are down to 3 workers because our last worker quit (because this job is stressful and lacks common sense). Well, today another worker announced he is leaving in two weeks. So this is causing panic. This causes millions of dollars in products to get backed up almost immediately because it's impossible to process being so short shifted.  \n  \nMy question, should I use this opportunity to ask for a raise?  \n  \nCan they really refuse my request at this point? I'm 50\/50 on if I'd just leave if they declined.  \n  \n","answer":"In the short term you may get a raise, but is there anything stopping your employer, in the long term, hiring someone cheaper and replacing you? This would depend on local labour laws, market rate for your job vs. what you are asking for and how easily it would be to train someone to do your job. I'm an Engineer in a highly specialised field that's going through a downturn and I can tell you that nobody is indispensable."}
{"question":"What I learned by losing $8k today from selling naked AMC calls. Here's a picture of the two positions I opened and then bought back to close.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OPOMXyE.png\n\nFirst position: AMC June 4th 2021 $50 strike price, sold 4 contracts at $3.45, bought back about 2 hours later at $12.90, lost $3,780\n\nSecond position:  AMC June 4th 2021 $70 strike price, sold 4 contracts at $6.00, bought back 40 minutes later at $16.55, lost $4,220.\n\n$3780 + $4220 = Total $8k loss in a few hours. \n\nI received a phonecall from Ameritrade after the second set of calls I sold. The guy told me that due to their risk assessment I would have to close the position before the end of the trading day.\n\nThen 30 minutes later they called me and told me I had to close the position *immediately*. \n\nThey had changed the stress stress from a stock price gain of 20% to a stock price gain of 110%.  So initially I had enough cash reserves to cover the stress test.  When they raised the stress to +110% I was looking at approximately ($70 x 110% x 4 contacts x 100) = $30.8K \n\nAt that point I only had around $8k cash value in the account.\n\nSo lesson learned.  Be aware that the cash reserve requirements may be raised on you significantly with naked options where you actually are forced to liquidate before you want to.  I still think the $70 strike price calls I sold will expire worthless. \n\nThis was my mistake for not adequality funding my account on the off chance that they would raise the stress test from 20% stock gain to 110% stock gain.","answer":"As my buddy Dwight Schrute always says, \u201cWhenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?'

{"question":"My less than usual path to FIRE, not another \"Bay area tech industry, 6 figure salary\" story I promise. [22 M in Toronto] This is really the only place I can share my story since I can't explain FIRE to any regular person. And yes I admit this is kind of a humble brag, I am quite happy with my situation. Also, I feel this is a bit different from the usual \"Bay area tech industry, 6 figure salary\" stories for some change. Funny enough, my brother is a $100k USD+ techy in a HCOL city with a fortune 500 company, but that's beside the point.\n\n**Backstory**\n\nI work in the hospitality industry at a restaurant which comes with a unique situation. I have no benefits, nor time paid off but get to choose exactly how much I want to work. No formal education other than a couple of college courses, but a lot of time spent independently educating myself to further my career.\n\nI live in Toronto, Canada. Share a 700sqft 2br with a roommate in the downtown core. Live relatively frugally in some areas, but also splurge an absurd amount in others. I recognize I am very fortunate to be in the situation I am in, and also that there are many ways I can still improve my spending. Anyway, break down of my finances from past 12 months.\n\n**Finances**\n\nEssentials | Amount\n---|---\nRent | $890\nPhone | $50\nInternet | $30\nInsurance | $45\nHydro | $30\n**Non-essentials** | \nGroceries | $160\nHobbies | $30\nPublic Transit | $80\nCab\/Uber | $50\nCoffee | $20\nDining | $450\nMonthly Total | $1,845\/mth\n--- | ---\n**Yearly** | \nVacation | $3,000\nEducation | $1,500\nMisc. Purchases | $1,000\n--- | ---\nTotal | $27,520\/yr\n\n\nBreakdown | Amount\n---|---\nApprox. Income | $75,500\nIncome Tax | $19,000\nSpending | $27,500\nSavings | $29,000\nSavings % (post tax) | 51%\nCurrent portfolio | $85,000\nYears to FIRE | 13-15 Yrs\n\n**Couple notes:**\n \n1. **Insurance**, for now, is just renter's insurance and long-term disability insurance. I bought the latter due to the risks associated with working a physically dependent job. I also need to buy extended medical coverage soon, for things not covered by Canadian health care.\n\n2. **I walk to work** every day, a nice perk of living in the downtown core, 15 mins usually. But the public transit costs are still quite high because I often go around the city for other activities.\n\n3. **My hobbies**, outside of dining out, are mostly free or extremely cheap. I play sports at the community center which is usually free. I am competing in an amateur billiards league. The league is very affordable and I practice during the days when the rates are lower. A small perk of working nights I guess.\n\n4. **My dining budget is obscenely high**, I know. In my defense, it is my only serious vice. Also, it is my profession, being well informed about the current state of the industry and food scene has helped me in my career.\n\n5. **Education** covers the many books I buy and tastings I attend to improve my knowledge and hopefully further my career.\n\n6. **\"Purchases\"** is a very broad category that covers random things I end up having to buy. I barely own anything, I never go shopping or own any boy toys. It's mostly things like my laptop breaking after 7 years or having to spend $400+ on formal attire for a new job, these are unavoidable. I rarely spend the full 1k, I save the rest if there is extra.\n\n7. **I work 45-47h\/wk**  between my two jobs when I am working. This averages across the year to 44h\/wk because I take time off which is unpaid in my profession. Usually, 2 weeks in a single vacation and a couple other random days here and there add up to approx. 3+ weeks off.\n\n8. **I declare my tips in full**, which is rare in the industry. This really helped me in getting my first lease since I have some proof of income. I also hope this makes it easier for me to get a mortgage, will have to meet with a broker soon to find out for sure.\n\n9. **Do not quit your job and apply to a restaurant.** My story is a rose-tinted one, 99% of service staff do not make this much. Only several restaurants in major cities pay this well, and those positions are extremely competitive. That being said, if you know what you are getting into and are cut out for it, it is a satisfying and well-paying job.\n\nEDIT: Because this has come up in several comments\n\nNote 10. I get fed at work, a very common perk of any decent restaurant. Although this is the first time it is being listed on my paystub as a taxable benefit LOL. My new company is very above board...","answer":"51% savings rate at that income level and apologizes for his one vice, being a foodie.\n\nYou seem to have a wonderful work ethic and sense of priorities.

It seems that I can learn an eternity from all of you, so I thought there was no harm in painting the entire picture. As I mentioned before, I\u2019m currently 22 - I\u2019ve recently graduated university with a degree in commerce (accounting finance). I\u2019m now working as a graduate full time at one of the big accounting firms. I got into selling sneakers when I was around 18 after returning from my gap year and since then I have profited around the $20,000 mark, by selling sneakers on the side whilst working and studying. Along with this however, I developed a gambling problem (which it took me some time to understand that it was a problem) - to which I\u2019ve lost around $10,000 punting as well as a few thousand in the share market. Now I\u2019m wanting to set myself up for success, so all my accounts have been excluded and I have been trying to stay away from the gambling side of things.

{"question":"Is it wise to save the majority of your paycheck? I understand the 50\/30\/20 rule, but what if your necessities don\u2019t take up 50% of your paycheck\/income? Would that mean you would put whatever you don\u2019t spend into savings?\nI\u2019m still young, I get allowance and I use that for my necessities while DoorDash pays for what I want on the side. I want to put a percentage of what I earn into savings.\n\nI understand people got very wealthy or and successful in life by not spending everything they get, which makes sense. It\u2019s not like one big paycheck made them \u201crich.\u201d I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s wise to save a lot more than 20%, and if there\u2019s any risks that could come from saving more than 20% that are not clearly obvious.\n\nAlso before anyone calls me out on \u201cbecoming rich is a vague and so typical of a dream to have,\u201d or that I shouldn\u2019t hope to become rich because it\u2019s incredibly difficult and an unrealistic desire, my dream isn\u2019t to become rich, my goal is to have absolute freedom to do whatever I want in life, and to be financially safe.\n(Rich just sounds\u2026 bad or a dumb dream to have).\nAlso don\u2019t be an asshole.\n\nSo yeah, is it wise to save more than 20% in this scenario?","answer":"&gt;I understand people got very wealthy or and successful in life by not spending everything they get, which makes sense. \n\nNo, really you don't.\n\nThe median income in the US is about 36k as of 2019. Let's say you save half of that, and let's say you don't just save it, but invest it.\n\nGranted, this is going to be somewhat unrealistic because income changes during ones lifetime, but then saving 50% is also pretty unrealistic, and I'm not trying to provide accurate numbers, just illustrate my point.\n\nAnyway, so you invest 18k a year or 1.5k a month for 30 years at 8%.\n\nAfter *30 years* that comes out to about 2 million dollars. Like, it's not that that's not a lot of money, but it's also a lifetime of work, and barely scraping what you'd call \"rich\".\n\nNow for the party piece. Imagine you have a (graduate) degree in computer science, your average salary will be about 120k, say you invest half of that, now you'll end up with almost 7 million. And you *still* have $5000 a month in disposable income!\n\nIf you can't save a *lot* you will never really end up a lot, and to even have the ability to save a lot, you need income.\n\nSo the best \"investment\" advice is frankly, go to college, get a degree, find a job you like. That is the most reliable road to financial independence by far.\n\n&gt;So yeah, is it wise to save more than 20% in this scenario?\n\nSure. Like, don't starve yourself or anything, but there's nothing wrong with not spending money. Or at least saving up. The best thing you can do is take that as a stepping stone for yourself, that can be something relatively small like being able to buy a car to find better jobs, or something bigger like helping to pay for college."}

{"question":"Story: I almost lost $802K today and I did it for $4100 in options premium. Don't do that. I thought I had a brilliant, fool proof strategy that the market didn't know and I was first to discover but I was wrong.\n\nThe strategy:  Find weekly options deep out of the money that yield at least 0.5% of the capital requirement. The shot strike price must be below the 200 moving day average and you leverage up to get decent premiums.\n\nI started this in May 2021 selling deep out of the money TSLA naked puts. Then I realized this uses too much margin, so I learnt about credit spreads but I didn't act on it. Then came big tech earnings week and I decided to lay low and not trade at all, but then my tool scanned and found the AMZN deep out of the money puts are yielding similar returns to TSLA, which is basically almost impossible to find in the market unless it's something like AMC or other meme stocks.\n\nI decided to pull the trigger, so I sold 3280 shot, and bought 3200 long on 7\/28 expiring 7\/30. AMZN was trading north of 3650. I was certain it wouldn't drop 10% or even get close.\n\nWell after hours happened and I paniced, my life flashed before me, I had levered up $525000 in my account, and I also had levered up my wife's account for $280,000 for a total of $800,000.\n\nThis wasn't a YOLO, it wasn't a double my money scheme. I was thinking I could do this 52 weeks in a year, collect 0.5% yield on $800,000 of collateral and move to Hawaii.\n\nIt didn't work out like that. When the markets opened, I got out of the position with $76K of damage, and wiped out all my gains and then some, but I'm thankful to everyone who helped me here on reddit (elsewhere) and WSB discord, and of course my wife who when she found out we'd lose $800,000 just said, don't worry at least we'll be together.\n\nSo cautionary tale for those selling levered up bull put credit spreads and\/or naked TSLA puts, those black swan events you don't think you can get close to ... well you can.\n\nEDIT: I lost $76K closing the position.\n\nEDIT 2: I had all my margin used up, so I needed to wire in more cash, which thankfully my broker makes available immediately, so that's how I actually closed the trade.\n\nEDIT 3: Please note, this was not a YOLO, I was not considering this as a gambling thing, but of course I know how it is now, but I'm not a YOLOer is what I wanted to say.\n\nEDIT 4: I have hundreds of DMs asking me how I found the spread, I will buy a new domain, host my app on that and you can all have at it for free. But I mean I hope you know it's not as good as it sounds given my post.\n\nEDIT 5: Proof: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/HK0D5Yp](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/HK0D5Yp)\n\nEDIT 6: Many of you are commenting here, and DMing why I closed the position. I've had more hours to reflect on this, and I think I was worried about being unable to close the trade due to (potentially) diminishing buying power. I closed the trade about 4 minutes into the session so I did think twice about not closing it, but I don't know I made a judgement call. So ultimately, risk management and position sizing were the fatal flaws of this trade. On a side note, I wish broker dealers would let you CLOSE your positions if you have enough collateral even if you have exhausted your buying power due to Reg T rules.\n\nEDIT 7: I've been told this has happened here before, look at this guy: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/h0l5uw\/200k_yolo_on_spy_612_314_312_puts_credit_spread\/","answer":"OP, I am confused.

What to expect from the first months (for me and my family)?\n\nThis community has really helped med see my options in new ways - as well as given me technical insights and understand the different financial-personal life-paths that are available to us and how they are intertwined.\n\nI wont mention all the insights and decision You guys helped form but they include:\n\n* Going into very focused planning-mode next 12 months rather than just \"taking the leap tomorrow\" or \"grind out another year and see what happens\"\n* Obviously activating my way too large large cash position more in low cost ETF \/index funds - but in a hold and leave strategy. Increase my investment knowledge but without day-trading or investigating individual shares.\n* Be more conservative in my expected return and change my withdrawal rate to 2,75% even if it means moving the goal posts 12 months and being a little more frugal on post FIRE budgets - incl stress-testing them in real life over the next year\n* Find 2 completely independent financial advisors\n* Invite my wife to be part of the journey but be prepared that most of my friends will probably not be the best sparring partners on these issues - simply because talking about this stuff brings up all kinds of personal emotions, projections and biases in people\n* Investigate and try out a couple of the most efficient frugality hacks of our leanFIRE colleagues and enjoying the math in calculating how each month adds to the \"freedom-machine\" which is my nest -egg BUT still let myself splurge when it is important. Spoiling my self and others and remembering to be grateful for the relationships and options in my life.\n* And most importantly - enjoying the choices and the journey regardless of the exact numbers.\n\nSo I am truly grateful to the active posters and commenters in this community for taking the time to comment and share insights, strategies, goals, pains, doubts and victories...\n\nthanks guys - I am ready for strategizing, planning and getting my feet wet the next months -  and specifically for my meetings with banks next week. Input from this forum made me ready in a way I just couldn't have been with the help of my accountant, wife, friends and financial advisors, each affected by their own bias and self-interest and without the experience-based cross-over points between strategy-choices-life-emotions that You guys have offered.\n\nTHANK YOU .... and good luck on the journey for everybody here... fatcats, midwesteners, high net worth Bay Area Tech guys in their early 30s, people struggling with the grind or with loneliness, aspiring real estate moguls and everybody trying to work out goals, purpose, habits, freedom and just being in control of our own lives.","answer":"Great post and congrats. Yes, this community is amazing if you disregard the troll posts and just take what works for you. I think you should take the plunge asap. You\u2019re still young with plenty of time to discover a new life, but one or two more years of savings won\u2019t materially change your financial situation or your lived experience in FATfire. For those of us who got here the slow steady way, it becomes very clear when another year of W2 has very little impact on your life if you are intending to move on soon. Think you\u2019re at this point. \n\nI believe 3% is the correct\/optimal SWR for FATfire oriented folks. Provides very high downside protection on the one hand, and a substantial likelihood of ending up with a substantially greater sum to pass on to your heirs or charities or both, which I think a lot folks here aspire to. I personally model 6% nominal returns on a portfolio of mostly equities, and planning for a 3% WR. I strongly believe that solving for a materially lower than 3% WR is misguided if your goal is to move on soon. \n\nGreat post"}
{"question":"Gamestop Raising $1B Through Shares Tells Me Squeeze is Coming Reposting here because r\/GME seems a bit odd this morning. Need to get more visibility on this, so people aren't alarmed by the news. It's a good thing!\n\nTLDR; Gamestop is positioning to kick HFs in the teeth, as they climb on board the rocket too. They don't plan to sell the new shares for less than $285, in fact, potentially they will sell them for way more ($10M each even); Shills and Media will attempt to spin this into a negative (dilution is laughable with how concentrated we are from the synthetic shorts).  I'm convinced the GME board is mocking the HFs at this point. It's beautiful.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nOk, I'll keep this brief, but I wanted to share what I see in this Gamestop announcement.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p4yqr09ocdr61.png?width=2185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10e8e87eca417e7e8d90040f90dfd01936c67bab\n\nWords are important. Also, timing. They tell a story. Put yourself in the mind of Gamestop's new CFO and board. You see an imminent squeeze coming, you've already projected it in your SEC filings, and you most likely (disclaimer, theorizing here) are about to set in motion the event that will lead to the world seeing this for what it is (share recall, voter count) within the next few days.\n\nCould this motivate you to announce that you are allowing Jefferies to raise $1,000,000,000 dollars on up to 3.5 million shares. **They are not saying they are going to sell 3.5M shares, they are saying in \"no event\" will the company \"sell more than\" 3.5 million.**\n\nGamestop doesn't need cash quickly, but they could certainly use it in the long run to roll out their plan to dominate the Electronics ecommerce business. They aren't in a rush to get more cash, because as we saw in their Q4 Earnings Report two weeks ago, they have over $600M in cash on hand already.\n\nSo why now? Why raise $1B when you have $500M on hand. Why pre-market on a Monday prior to the new 005 rulings? Timing is everything...\n\nMy take on this, is that Gamestop knows it's about to launch, and they want to be on the rocket. Having (up to) 3.5M shares ready to sell for HFs that may be after 20M, 100M, 500M shares shorted is a way to raise $1B for the business easily and launch Gamestop on it's path to ecommerce nirvana. This will do next to nothing to slow the launch (feel free to dispute this in the comments, I'm happy to debate :) ).\n\nA word about dilution, because you'll read it all over the news. It's the word used to put fear in investors. This is different. GME is so concentrated, from the SI (all those fake shares floating around) that calling 3.5M new shares a dilution is laughable in comparison to how many shares need to be bought back that are fake.\n\n# Ape Analogy Time: Bananas On Sale\n\nImagine... owning 100 banana's... you're the guy in town people turn to for banana's when they need them. Now a snake (Kenny G) crawls into town proclaiming to have 900 banana's and offering IOUs to everyone in town, selling for cheap, then trying to sneak away with the cash (but you've got him by the tail). When you come across 3 new banana's this snake screams to everyone! \"Hey, now that guy has 103 bananas, not 100, he's charging you guys too much, lower the price!\" Snake is trying to deflect from his situation... owning 900 banana's he doesn't have, so he's telling everyone to focus on your 3% increase in banana's instead. In this situation, you wouldn't sell your 103 banana's... you'd wait for snake to make due on his 900 banana debt. You also wouldn't worry about the 3 new banana's until he did.\n\n# Important To Note\n\nNot putting a price on anything... not putting a date on anything... but how many shares would it take to raise $1,000,000,000 if GME were $10M a share? Just a simple question :)\n\nStay safe out there Apes. Much love to you all.\n\n**\\*\\*\\* Edit 1 \\*\\*\\*** Uncle Bruce brought up a good point this morning. This $1B offering has no time limit, and might become a bidding war from the shorted HFs, all of them trying to get a ticket out of their horribly position. Problem is, there aren't enough shares for them all. It could be that this offering, that Jefferies has been given the rights to sell, will go up for bid and may price way way higher than $300, simply because many HFs would love to get their hands on a large position of shares without having to go on the market to cover their shorts (think of it as say buying your way out of a 1M short mistake for $1B)... again, they can't all do this, at the shorted ratios we're potentially seeing. The bidding war could actually drive price of GME higher than it would have otherwise been without this offering. I'm convinced they are likely to raise $1B for less than 3.5M shares when this is all said and done.\n\n**\\*\\*\\* Edit 2 \\*\\*\\*** typos; formatting\n\n**\\*\\*\\* Edit 3 \\*\\*\\*** I'm convinced the GME board is literally mocking the HFs -- it's quite hilarious to watch this play out in real time. Why do you think we're back up at last weeks levels so quickly after the media negative reporting of this wore off? It's people opening their eyes to see how positive this is for Gamestop.\n\n**\\*\\*\\* Edit 4 \\*\\*\\***\n\n# The fight over these shares might go something like this:\n\nHedge Fund 1 - \"ok, I'll take your 3.5M shares for $575,000M seems fair, that's kind of like current price ($165ish a share)\"\n\nHedge Fund 2 notices GME is up from open (eek, those apes are buying more despite the media reporting!) \"Wait a minute... I'll buy them for $650,000 ($185 a share)\n\nHedge Fund 3 notices other two HFs are bidding and sees opportunity to unload it's 2M fake shorts without spooking the market... \"Hey! I'll give you $1B for 2M shares!\" ($500 a share)\n\nHedge Fund 1 realizes this is getting ugly and doesn't want his HF competitor to get these shares: \"Wait, wait... I'll revise my offer to $1B for 1.5M shares\"\n\nHedge Fund 2 noticed launch engines igniting, Gamestop just recalled shares for voting: \"Ok, ok... I'll give you $1B for 1M shares! but only if you take my offer right now!\"\n\n...this continues... Gamestop sits back and laughs:\n\n*\"You guys do realize I don't have to sell any of these shares, yet...* \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf17 *\"*","answer":"Thank you, this makes total sense.. And if so, it is clever as fuck, RC gonna fuck those Hfs hard, nail them to the ground and feast on their remains. All that to take us with him to Valhalla. \n\nLove this scenario, love you all.

{"question":"I just paid off $19k in debt across 9 credit cards. Can I close the accounts? So I made the mistake of opening many lines of credit while in my 20s. For years I struggled to pay off the debt... buying things I didn't need, being stupid with purchases and using credit cards for, basically, a payday loan. I have spent an unfathomable amount of money on paying minimums. It's not the first time I've had problems with credit cards, but I NEED it to be the last time. \n\nRight now I'm in a good situation. I make very good money (not \"fuck you money\") but enough that I was able to pay off my cards and pocket a bit into savings.  I keep my minimum monthly expenses low by cutting out the unnecessary expenses. I eat out once a week, bring lunches to work, cut out the cable bill and unnecessary subscriptions. I have a $217 car note and a manageable $1200 mortgage, both current, so I don't plan on any major purchases in the near future. I have student loans that are manageable but have a long way to go before they are paid off. They've been open and currenr for 10 years. \n\nMy question for you all is: can I close these credit card accounts? Should I keep one open just to show i have the credit available? I know its going to lower my available credit and length of account history, but is it worth the hit? \n\nI'm waiting for one more month of statements so I can make sure I do not have any residual interest coming and can assure I have a $0 balance for at least 2 months of statements before I close anything. I know FICO looks at utilization rate... how can I keep that from being 0%? I obviously do not have the discipline to just put one or two things on a credit card. Is autopaying an electric bill and autopaying the card every month a good option here? Also, I don't want to have to keep such a fine eye on all these lines of credit with the experian hack. Will future lenders look at me as disciplined enough to close these accounts or will they see it as a liability?  \n\nHoping for a little guidance here. Thanks everybody!","answer":"Don't close them. There's a better way to handle this that's very similar to closing them.\n\nI would suggest you take 7 of those cards and lock them away somewhere. Put a small bill like netflix, phone bill, internet bill on each of the cards with a recurring payment. And then set up autopay. \n\nThis way you will have\n\n1) Low utilization\n\n\n2) More accounts\n\n\n3) Good account history\n\n\n4) More ontime payments\n\n\n\nEdit: Downgrade\/product change the cards with an annual fee - it is not recommended to do use a card with an AF in this way.\n\nAs it has been pointed out below, it would also be recommended to check these cards for fraudulent charges once in a while. Although you can use services like Mint which could show all your credit card balances through logging in into one place - though I haven't tried this so it may not be viable."}
{"question":"AT&amp;T Announces Details for Completion of WM Spin-Off How do you all think this will affect the price of AT&amp;T stock after the spin off? I've read some predictions of a $3-4 drop after the spin-off.\n\nhttps:\/\/about.att.com\/story\/2022\/details-for-completion-of-warnermedia-spinoff.html\n\nDALLAS, March 25, 2022 \u2014 Today\u00a0AT&amp;T Inc.* (NYSE:T) announced that it has declared a stock dividend to effect the spin-off of 100% of AT&amp;T\u2019s interest in WarnerMedia to AT&amp;T\u2019s shareholders. The record date for the stock dividend is the close of business on April 5, 2022. This stock dividend is in connection with the previously announced transaction to combine AT&amp;T\u2019s WarnerMedia business with Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: DISCA, DISCB, DISCK). On the closing date of the transaction, anticipated to be in April, AT&amp;T shareholders will receive, on a tax-free basis, an estimated 0.24 shares of stock in Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (WBD) for each share of AT&amp;T common stock.\u00a0\n\nAT&amp;T shareholders as of the stock dividend record date will be entitled to receive shares of WarnerMedia Spinco common stock, representing 100% of AT&amp;T\u2019s interest in WarnerMedia. Immediately following this spin-off, the WarnerMedia Spinco shares will be exchanged for stock representing approximately 71% of the new WBD on a fully diluted basis. The exact number of shares of WBD common stock to be received by AT&amp;T shareholders for each AT&amp;T common share will be determined immediately before the closing based on the number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock outstanding and the number of shares of Discovery common stock outstanding on an as\u2011converted and as\u2011exercised basis.\n\nAT&amp;T shareholders do not need to take any action. Their WarnerMedia Spinco shares will automatically be exchanged for WBD common stock in the merger, which will occur on the closing date of the transaction. Following close of the transaction, AT&amp;T shareholders will continue to hold, along with their new shares of WBD common stock, the same number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock they held immediately prior to close. After close, investors should expect that AT&amp;T\u2019s share price will adjust to reflect the transfer of the WarnerMedia business to the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery entity.\n\nFactors that May Affect the Timing of the Spin-Off\n\nThe timing of the spin-off is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions for the transaction. If certain closing conditions are not satisfied or waived in advance of April 5, AT&amp;T may elect to change the stock dividend record date to a later date.\n\nAT&amp;T Declares Dividends on Common and Preferred Stock\n\nWith the close of the pending WarnerMedia transaction expected in April, the AT&amp;T board of directors today also declared a second quarter dividend of $0.2775 per share on the company\u2019s common stock. While future dividends remain subject to board approval, this amount is consistent with AT&amp;T\u2019s previous announcement that the board had approved an expected post-close annual common dividend of $1.11 per share. At the updated rate, AT&amp;T\u2019s stock remains among the best dividend-yielding stocks in the United States and in the Fortune 500.\n\nAdditionally, the board of directors declared quarterly dividends on the company\u2019s 5.000% Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, and the company\u2019s 4.750% Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C. The Series A dividend is $312.50 per preferred share, or $0.3125 per depositary share. The Series C dividend is $296.875 per preferred share, or $0.296875 per depositary share.\n\nDividends on the common stock and Series A and Series C preferred stock are payable on May 2, 2022, to shareholders of record of the respective shares at the close of business on April 14, 2022.\n\nThe board of directors also declared an annual dividend on the company\u2019s Fixed Rate Reset Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, of \u20ac2,875.00 per preferred share. Dividends on the Series B preferred stock are payable on May 3, 2022, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 14, 2022.\n\nTwo-Way Trading for AT&amp;T Stock Expected to Begin on April 4\n\nAT&amp;T has been advised by the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) that beginning on the trading day immediately prior to the April 5 record date for the spin-off distribution (currently April 4) and continuing through the close of trading on the business day before the closing date of the merger,1\u00a0there will be two markets in AT&amp;T common stock on the NYSE: a \"regular way\" market and an \"ex-distribution\" market. During this period of two-way trading in AT&amp;T common stock, there will also be a market on the Nasdaq for WBD common stock on a \u201cwhen issued\u201d (\u201cWI\u201d) basis.\n\nThe trading options that will be available during the two-way trading period are:\n\nAT&amp;T Regular Way Trading\nIf, during the period of two-way trading, an AT&amp;T shareholder sells a share of AT&amp;T common stock in the regular way market under AT&amp;T's NYSE symbol, \"T,\" the shareholder will be selling both the share of AT&amp;T common stock and the right to receive shares of WBD common stock in the transaction.\n\nAT&amp;T Ex-distribution Trading\nIf, during the period of two-way trading, an AT&amp;T shareholder sells a share of AT&amp;T common stock in the ex-distribution market under the temporary NYSE symbol \"T WI,\" the AT&amp;T shareholder will be selling only a share of AT&amp;T common stock and will retain the right to receive shares of WBD common stock in the transaction.\n\nWBDWV Trading\nDuring the two-way trading period, an AT&amp;T shareholder also has the option of selling the right to receive shares of WBD common stock while retaining shares of AT&amp;T common stock. This option will be available under the temporary Nasdaq symbol \"WBDWV\".\n\nTrades under the symbols \"T WI\" and \"WBDWV\" will settle after the closing date of the WarnerMedia-Discovery transaction. If the transaction is not completed, all trades made under these temporary symbols will be cancelled.\n\nIn all cases, investors should consult with their financial and tax advisors regarding the specific implications of selling shares of their AT&amp;T common stock or the right to receive shares of WBD common stock on or before the closing date of the WarnerMedia-Discovery transaction.","answer":"I've got att calls. In my opinion att stock will drop in value in proportion to the offset new stock listing. Holding shares is fine because you regain the value in the new company.

Lots of good points here that I hadn't considered - mainly the effect price per share has on the options market.\n\nThat said, I feel like the options market is a big reason why folks feel like the market is disconnected from reality (and gamified). I wonder if this plays into why BRK-A never got a split.

{"question":"Equifax tweets phishing site to impacted consumers 3 times before noticing, sending 200,000 visitors to fake clone [How fucking dumb can this company be?](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/RhSgftv.png)\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/09\/20\/business\/equifax-fake-website.html\n\nBy MAGGIE ASTOR\nSEPT. 20, 2017\n\n&gt; People create fake versions of big companies\u2019 websites all the time, usually for phishing purposes. But the companies do not usually link to them by mistake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Equifax, however, did just that after Nick Sweeting, a software engineer, created an imitation of equifaxsecurity2017.com, Equifax\u2019s page about the security breach that may have exposed 143 million Americans\u2019 personal information. Several posts from the company\u2019s Twitter account directed consumers to Mr. Sweeting\u2019s version, securityequifax2017.com. They were deleted after the mistake was publicized.\n&gt; \n&gt; By Wednesday evening, the Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers had blacklisted Mr. Sweeting\u2019s site, and he took it down. By that time, he said, it had received about 200,000 hits.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately for the people who clicked, Mr. Sweeting\u2019s website was upfront about what it was. The layout was the same as the real version, complete with an identical prompt at the top: \u201cTo enroll in complimentary identity theft protection and credit file monitoring, click here.\u201d But a headline in large text differed: \u201cCybersecurity Incident &amp; Important Consumer Information Which is Totally Fake, Why Did Equifax Use A Domain That\u2019s So Easily Impersonated By Phishing Sites?\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Continue reading the main story\n&gt; RELATED COVERAGE\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Answers to Your Questions About the Equifax Hack SEPT. 17, 2017\n&gt; \n&gt; Prosecutors Open Criminal Investigation Into Equifax Breach SEPT. 18, 2017\n&gt; Equifax Says Cyberattack May Have Affected 143 Million in the U.S. SEPT. 7, 2017\n&gt; It would be just as easy for phishers to create their own versions of the Equifax page, and that would be bad news for anyone entering the information required to enroll in identity theft protection: their surname and the last six digits of their Social Security number. (In Mr. Sweeting\u2019s version, the form was disabled so that no information was saved.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cTheir site is dangerously easy to impersonate,\u201d Mr. Sweeting said in an email, noting that he had created the site solely to draw attention to the weakness of Equifax\u2019s security. \u201cIt only took me 20 minutes to build my clone. I can guarantee there are real malicious phishing versions already out there.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to get Equifax to change this site to a reputable domain,\u201d he added. \u201cI knew it would only cost me $10 to set up a site that would get people to notice, so I just did it.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; In a short statement on Wednesday, Equifax said all posts containing the wrong link had been deleted.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWe apologize for the confusion,\u201d the statement said. \u201cConsumers should be aware of fake websites purporting to be operated by Equifax. Our dedicated website for consumers to learn more about the incident and sign up for free credit monitoring is https:\/\/www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, and our company homepage is equifax.com. Please be cautious of visiting other websites claiming to be operated by Equifax that do not originate from these two pages.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; An Equifax spokeswoman, Marisa Salcines, did not respond when asked why the company had created a separate website rather than a subdomain of equifax.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; That, cybersecurity experts said, was the key mistake. Phishers cannot create a page on the equifax.com domain, so if the website were hosted there instead, it would be easy for users to tell that the page was legitimate.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cYou would think that would be the obvious place to start,\u201d said Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cCreate a subdomain so that if somebody tries to fake it, it becomes immediately obvious.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cEquifaxsecurity2017.com,\u201d on the other hand, looks so unofficial that Mr. Telang said even he had been unsure at first whether it was safe to enter his information.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Sweeting explained in his email that a Linux command, \u201cwget,\u201d allows anyone to download the contents of a website, \u201cincluding all images, HTML, CSS, etc.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cIt was super easy to just suck their whole site down with wget and throw it on a $5 server,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt currently has the same type of SSL certificate as the real version, so from a trust perspective, there\u2019s no way for users to authenticate the real one vs. my server.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Telang said Equifax\u2019s actions suggested that the company had never anticipated or planned for a data breach.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a plan in place, you will find different ways to screw it up,\u201d he said. \u201cEquifax is just a perfect example of that.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; All of the incorrect tweets ended with \u201c-Tim,\u201d indicating the name of the Equifax employee who wrote them. The Equifax spokeswoman did not say whether any disciplinary action had been taken, and Mr. Sweeting said he hoped the employee had not been fired.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThey probably just Googled for the URL and ended up finding the fake one instead,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real blame lies with the people who originally decided to set the site up badly.\u201d","answer":"I want to buy the dip, but they keep shooting themselves in the foot over and over again...\n\nDelayed disclosure of breach by months (with apparently little\/poor planning despite all of that time), only moved to patch the bug after they had already lost the data,senior executives potentially conducted insider trading, attempted to pull a fast one on panicking people with a Terms of Service trick, admin for username and password in Argentina, brushed off an older breach back in March, and now this.\n\nOn the flip side, there is already a bill in Congress that might limit Equifax's legal liabilities: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/news\/comments\/70zr44\/congress_introduced_hr2359_that_will_limit\/"}
{"question":"How to NOT miss out on Slock.It (or any other) token sale The last ~24 hours may have been chaos if you tried to participate in the Digix crowdsale. The FOMO was strong, the cap was looming, there were unexpected issues, blah blah blah. You can blame anyone you want, but it doesn't fix the real core issue: people were NOT prepared.\n\nSo, instead of waiting until the next big thing launches to FOMO-fart so hard you launch to the ceiling &amp; hit your head and come crashing down, prepare yourself now. Blaming after the fact doesn't solve anything.\n\n## Research and make an investment decision FIRST.\n\nThis means do your research about the company, the DAO, the contracts, the sale itself, etc, NOW. Stay abreast of ongoing developments via the slack channels, reddit, gitter channels etc. Ask questions. Get answers.\n\nDecide how much you want to invest BEFORE the chaos ensues. Make that decision and stick with it. Of course, things may impact your decision, but you can plan for these as well. Say, I will invest 100ETH into the sale. IF the sale reaches $50m, I will invest another 100ETH. \n\n## Get your flipping ETH off an exchange and into a wallet your control\n\nOne of the more common issues were people who store their funds in an exchange. The only funds you should have on an exchange are those in which you are actively trading. If you plan on investing any ETH into a sale, these should be **in a wallet you control.** Preferably, *before* the token sale starts. ;)\n\nDue to the nature of token sales, the best place for these are in the [official Ethereum Wallet client](https:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/mist\/releases). There are a ton of tutorials on how to download, install, troubleshoot, and get your Ethereum Wallet running. There are answers to every question you have on reddit and stackexchange. Use Google or ask for help. Do this **now**. It will take a couple days to sync. It will take a couple days for you to become familiar with the interface. Set up a new account. Send some tests to and from the account. \n\n**IF** for some reason you absolutely cannot use Ethereum Wallet, we at MyEtherWallet.com will be providing an interface similar to the Digix interface for you to participate in the Slock.it (and probably other token sales).

{"question":"In the UK, in the 90s was there really 10% bank interest? Just been on another thread, where people were discussing BANK INTEREST being 10% in the 90s, and this being the only investment that people needed to make (rather than stocks\/ real estate).\n\nWas this really the case ? People would just have savings accounts and no investments?\n\nIf so, didn\u2019t this make it impossible to buy a house? Think 15% mortgage interest rates etc?","answer":"&gt; didn\u2019t this make it impossible to buy a house?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuite the opposite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHigher interest rates reduce prices, making homes more affordable and making BTL riskier and less appealing to landlords.

{"question":"Yes, wages are not keeping up with inflation, but isn\u2019t that the point? I\u2019ve read quite a few articles over the past 6 months that frame the current cost-of-living stress in Australia as a result of the disparity between wage growth and the rate of inflation.  Here is where my confusion enters.  \n\nMy understanding is that the country\u2019s current approach to fighting inflation is to reduce the typical household\u2019s purchasing power through interest rate hikes.  Decreased purchasing power results in decreased demand.  Decreased demand forces companies to lower prices or they\u2019ll have no one left to buy their goods or services.  So, if wages kept up with inflation, companies wouldn\u2019t be forced into a position where prices must be lowered and inflation would continue.\n\nSo why is it that the media points at this disparity between wage growth and inflation as if it isn\u2019t a big part of the strategy to combat inflation itself?  Isn\u2019t it that stifling demand through the reduction of real wages is precisely the strategy chosen to try and bring inflation backdown to the 2-3% sweet-spot?  Or am I getting something wrong here?","answer":"Wait till you learn that reserve banks monitor unemployment and will increase interest rates if unemployment gets \u2018too low\u2019 (see: the NAIRU), out of fear that low unemployment will increase wages and thereby cause inflation. They suppress wage growth even *before* inflation ever happens. \n\nNow we have inflation and wage suppression at the same time. So it\u2019s not a \u2018wage-price\u2019 spiral but rather a \u2018profit-price\u2019 spiral. Companies are increasing prices not to keep up with wages but to meet profit targets. \n\nWhen profits are growing and wages are not it is essentially a transfer of wealth from the working class to the owning class."}
{"question":"why would anyone invest in Bond Funds? I just don't get it.\n\nI know the advantages of bonds: they are much safer than stocks, they give consistent payments, and the market fluctuations don't matter since you get your investment back at the end of maturity.\n\nWith the current 4+% yield it makes a lot of sense to directly hold some bonds, but bond funds seem like a different story.\n\nTheir value is constantly fluctuating, and you are not guaranteed to get your investment back since they rarely hold bonds until they mature. and if they are poorly managed, they could be forces to sell huge chunks of bonds at a loss like it happened in the UK 2 months ago.\n\ni know that they are more diversified, but the downsides are severe. if I would want to invest in something that is volatile and doesn't guarantee I get my money back at the end but is diversified then why wouldn't I buy a stock etf instead?","answer":"Owning a bond fund is equivalent to owning a ladder of individual bonds and constantly rolling them as they mature. They are great for getting general bond exposure without having to manage a ladder yourself.\n\nYou can always \u201cget your money back\u201d from a bond fund, but you need to wait the length of the duration. You would do this by selling the shares of the bond fund and transitioning to an individual bond of the same duration. Then, when that bond matures, you will have made back any money you \u201clost\u201d while owning the bond fund. This is because, if a bond fund of duration X is down by Y%, then the price of an individual bond of duration X is also down by approximately Y%. You are selling low but also buying low, so it all cancels out.\n\nThe idea that bond funds are more risky than individual bonds is wrong. Individual bonds fluctuate in value on a daily basis the same way that bond funds do. The only difference is that an individual bond decreases its duration over time, while a bond fund maintains a constant duration. Bond funds are only harmful if you buy the wrong duration and\/or hold for the wrong amount of time.\n\nYou should hold individual bonds if you need the money for a specific purpose on a known date. You should hold bond funds if you just want general exposure to bonds, and you transition that money to individual bonds when you have a specific timeline.\n\nI recommend [this wiki page](https:\/\/www.bogleheads.org\/wiki\/Individual_bonds_vs_a_bond_fund) for more detail."}
{"question":"The S&amp;P 500 has an average annual RoI of 7% - 10%. Other indices return at comparable rates.

If, on average, returns are greater than the rate of inflation, why do investors so commonly end up with significant losses or net-zero returns?\n\nIs it a matter of perception? Is it that the average investor actually *does* have a positive RoI, but I'm more likely to hear about those who lose?","answer":"Don't you realise that a lot of investors don't buy index funds? That they trade individual stocks in order to try to beat the indexes, but in doing so increase their risk and loss\/gain potential. \n\nHedge funds for example believe they can beat the indexes so they execute active strategies by researching and trading individual stocks. But studies show that a whopping 90% of hedge funds fail to beat their respective indexes over a 10 year period. \n\nAs to why investors continue to invest in active strategies with such poor odds of success, I guess the appeal of potential greater gains is too much to resist.

{"question":"Has your viewpoint of your own financial independence changed by traveling to third world countries and seeing incredible poverty? After I inherited lots of money and combined it with my savings and investments from 25 years of putting money away, I looked at my bank and brokerage accounts and became very philosophical.\n\nI decided I wanted to see the world, and specifically third world countries.  (Also called developing countries).  Yes, I had traveled before, but mostly to Europe and resort destinations. This time my wife and I took off on a round the world two month adventure.  We wanted to see how people lived in places where surviving was a day to day challenge. We expected that while we could not save the world- it would give us a perspective on poverty and charity.\n\nWhat an experience!  We saw places of incredible beauty but also incredible ugly scenes.  We interacted with lots of desperate people who lived day to day. We saw hillsides of shantytowns and smelled unbelievable filth. Everyone we talked to wanted to move to America so they can become millionaires.\n\nWe returned home wondering why God allowed us to live in wealth when most of the world lives in poverty.\n\nI don't know if this experience will encourage us to try to be better investors with our money or just accept what we have.\n\nHow has exposure to poverty impacted your view of your own financial independence?\n\n(Added after reading the 333 replies to date:  I find a few things really interesting in peoples comments so far:\n\n1)  People try to link the poverty in America to the poverty in Third Word Countries:  OMG!  There is no comparison.\n\n2)  Lots of posters tell us that because of love and family in the third world countries even the poorest people seem happy.  Maybe true, but maybe the satisfaction many people in those countries have even though they are extremely poor is the reason they will stay poor forever. \n\n3) Many posters say that after seeing poverty overseas, they have cut down on materialistic spending.

{"question":"Why A Potential Gamma Squeeze Could Start Settling In (CRUSHING IV, PREMIUMS WILL START DROPPING IN PRICE!) **TLDR -**\n\nIV is being crushed heavily, soon enough we will start seeing call options go for cheaper then we've seen in a long time. People have a chance to stock up on weekly calls, this will cause Market Makers to have to stay delta neutral, buy more shares, and then the chain will begin. This could not happen before due to the IV being extremely high and calls being extremely pricy for us, however now is our second chance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets take a look at how the week has gone so far..\n\nDry volumes, travelling sideways, and people ready to make loads of money off calls.\n\n[\\(Volatility drying up, like this we will begin to see lower premiums\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vezrn8xowlr61.jpg?width=1451&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae5e8e2acb59c8e49ba47173d490f58a628cf069)\n\n**BUT OPTIONS FOR GME ARE BAD!**\n\nNot anymore, Options were bad a while ago when we had high premiums and IV was awful for us.

If people were to begin having weekly calls on GME, we could start seeing January level momentum again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT IF SHORTS START USING THIS IV?**\n\nNow that MM's and HF's are not able to re-short the same stock (LEGALLY) (not including loopholes), the issue with this begin to rise that they would only have X amount of shares to short. As these calls get cheaper, the more apes can jump onto this and potentially start a ramp-up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHY WOULD A GAMMA SQUEEZE HELP?**\n\nNow, lets say many people start buying weekly calls soon, the IV crush is always occurring, people will begin to get these calls for a lot cheaper then what they could have the last week of March, people will capitalize on this profit (also other firms). This will then create a cycle of setting up Market Makers to cause buying pressure.\n\nAs people buy these calls, the MM's will begin to have to hedge these and BUY shares as they will have to stay delta neutral. The only portion that can really affect this by lowering it would be either if\n\nA) Shorts hit hard and drop the price to match MM's\n\nB) They use puts so the MM's would not have to buy as many shares to stay neutral.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs this continues due to the mass volatility GME, if MM's were forced to buy a good chunk of shares, the price would start to skyrocket, making more calls ITM which furthermore would begin the call chain that could start taking us to new heights. At least until the hedge-funds get margin-called.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust a reminder, extremely OTM calls don't really help the situation! OTM calls are extremely risky, and if they are not ITM by the expiry time, you are just giving money to the hedgies! ALSO! Calls with expiry for months after!

Just a little tip for all of you who are looking into Calls new to it all!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALREADY HAVE ITM CALLS?**\n\nGreat! We love seeing apes in the green! Exercising those shares would be extremely valuable once the expiry comes close. If a MM was to not actually hedge those shares originally, they would be forced to hedge them at the moment you decide to exercise so they could pay you those nice and crispy GME shares!\n\nIf you were to sell your Call Contract instead of exercising, they would give you the money. If you had hedged those shares originally, they may sell those, if they did not hedge them (very risky and after certain time could be somewhat illegal),  but you sold your contract, they would simply pay you the profits and leave you be without having to even touch the stock.

{"question":"Boston Federal Reserve, MIT to release digital dollar prototypes as soon as July # Federal Reserve\u2019s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall Street\n\nThe financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve\u2019s work on a new digital currency.\n\nWall Street is not thrilled.\n\nBanks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.\n\nAs soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https:\/\/www.bostonfed.org\/people\/bank\/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.\n\nA digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they\u2019re not cut out.\n\nSeeing the threat to their profits, the banks\u2019 main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn\u2019t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.\n\n\u201cEveryone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,\u201d said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research &amp; Trading LLC](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/0211844D:US).\n\nLawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven\u2019t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it\u2019s making financial industry executives nervous.\n\n\u201cThe fire has been lit,\u201d said [Josh Lipsky](https:\/\/www.atlanticcouncil.org\/expert\/josh-lipsky\/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. \u201cThe world is moving very quickly on these projects.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn\u2019t go away, but its use would likely decline.\n\nUsing the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.\n\nThe U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don\u2019t have access to the banking system.\n\nIn video [remarks](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-03-18\/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks\u2019 concerns when he said \u201cdigital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.\u201d\n\nPowell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-03-22\/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has \u201can obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges\u201d and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn\u2019t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn\u2019t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.\n\nCunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn\u2019t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s work is meant to show what\u2019s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we\u2019ll be a year or so behind,\u201d Cunha said. \u201cThis will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.\u201d\n\nThe potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.\n\nSo is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can\u2019t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown\u2019s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.\n\n\u201cRushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,\u201d said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/0321782Z:US).\n\nThe ABA, which says it\u2019s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.\n\nTwo lobbyists for a large bank said they\u2019re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed\u2019s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.\n\nInterest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.\n\nSome of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.\n\nSpokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the \u201cSand Dollar,\u201d a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we\u2019re talking to them about how they think about design,\u201d said Visa\u2019s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/MS:US) conference earlier this month. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of talking, but there\u2019s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther countries [are further along](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-02-05\/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there\u2019s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.\n\nBrown earlier this month sent a [letter](https:\/\/www.banking.senate.gov\/imo\/media\/doc\/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. \u201cWe cannot be left behind,\u201d Brown wrote.\n\nAmong other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.\n\nAdvocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.\n\nA Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government\u2019s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans\u2019 spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.\n\nA U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that\u2019s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-03-22\/federal-reserve-s-digital-dollar-momentum-worries-wall-street?sref=w3vFo7gi](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-03-22\/federal-reserve-s-digital-dollar-momentum-worries-wall-street?sref=w3vFo7gi)","answer":"&gt; [Cunha] wouldn\u2019t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.\n\nVery cool that this will be open source but it's unlikely to use blockchain as that would remove much of the Fed's toolkit.\n\n&gt; A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange\n\nI would think the opposite, if anything this is as massive endorsement for Bitcoin even if it doesn't use blockchain technology.\n\nOverall very interesting.

First, please note that this is strictly not financial advice and just research I have compiled over weeks for entertainment purposes\u2014it's all-public information and not intended to affect the price action of any stock in any way, shape, or form.\n\nThe article will be divided into 3 major parts: SEC and the financial derivatives market, dark pools of credit swaps and synthetic shares today, FUD dispersal, and legal ramifications of naked shorting. I was motivated to write this article as a result of two conditions: the ongoing process of appointing Gary Gensler as the SEC chairman, and the revelation of the existence of massive dark pool trading certain meme stocks, in an effort, to bamboozle the retail investor.\n\n\\---THE SEC SECTION---\n\nGary Gensler, the former chairman of the CTFC (Commodities Trading Futures Commission) is currently in the process of being appointed the SEC chairman. Currently, the senate banking committee has approved Gensler at a 14-10 vote ([https:\/\/www.investmentnews.com\/senate-banking-committee-approves-gensler-nomination-203813](https:\/\/www.investmentnews.com\/senate-banking-committee-approves-gensler-nomination-203813) , [https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?509429-1\/sec-chair-cfpb-director-confirmation-hearing](https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?509429-1\/sec-chair-cfpb-director-confirmation-hearing) ), and he will be voted on by the Senate proper in a weeks time on April 12th ([https:\/\/www.thinkadvisor.com\/2021\/03\/31\/schwab-expects-activist-sec-under-gensler-senate-sets-confirmation-vote-date\/](https:\/\/www.thinkadvisor.com\/2021\/03\/31\/schwab-expects-activist-sec-under-gensler-senate-sets-confirmation-vote-date\/)) . He is expected to have bipartisan support and to be sworn in as the new SEC chairman. Gary Gensler is extraordinarily hated by Wall Street for a couple of reasons, the primary being that he is a hard-nosed regulator interested in the transparency of the marketplace and democratizing the information within it in favor of the little guy. This fundamentally goes against the closed country club nature of Wall Street, which is shown by the enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Act ([https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank\\_Wall\\_Street\\_Reform\\_and\\_Consumer\\_Protection\\_Act](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act) , [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp) ).\n\nThe last time Wall Street made a grievous market error was in 2008. This was due to the financial derivatives market and credit default swaps market having a massive correction ([https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/052715\/how-big-derivatives-market.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/052715\/how-big-derivatives-market.asp),  [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/derivative.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/derivative.asp) ). The financial derivatives market (futures, in particular) was designed by markets to allow farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, industrialists, producers, etc., to lock in prices and mitigate risk in the production and operation of businesses. Thus, the core of what these markets are about is to lock in prices for commodities and to manage risk for the supply chain. Thus, the derivatives market is quite essential to the supply management side of the real economy (the part of the economy where you and I work), as such any meltdowns in the derivatives market further deteriorate our economy; in 2008, this spilled over to the real market\u2014which combined are gigantic markets, estimated at 640 trillion dollars ([https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/052715\/how-big-derivatives-market.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/052715\/how-big-derivatives-market.asp) ) in market capitalization. According to Gary Gensler that represents roughly $22 of hedging for every dollar exchanged in the real economy ([https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?304711-1\/financial-regulations-consumer-protection](https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?304711-1\/financial-regulations-consumer-protection) ); this is from 2010 though, so it could be a lot higher right now. Such futures and swaps are invested in almost every aspect of our lives (food, fuel, mortgages, credit rates, interest rates, etc.). So, given the importance of the derivatives market, it must stay transparent and competitive; this was not the case in 2008.\n\nDue to two things being in play in 2008, dark pools and credit default swaps, specifically CDSs insuring against CDOs composed of collapsing mortgage bonds. As a result of the underlying assets (mortgages) defaulting at a rapid rate, causing the collapse of the bonds, causing the CDOs composed of the bonds to collapse\/default in price; causing the CDSs to kick in and insure against the original value of the bond upon inception of the CDSs. This transaction occurred, you guessed it, in dark pools. dark pools will be covered highly in-depth so bear with me, Gary Gensler\u2019s response needs to be analyzed first. First definitions:\n\nCDOs; collateralized debt obligations, think of these as financial products composed of multiple other financial products backed by assets like bonds, collateralized loans, etc. ([https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/cdo.asp#:\\~:text=A%20collateralized%20debt%20obligation%20(CDO)%20is%20a%20complex%20structured%20finance,derived%20from%20another%20underlying%20asset](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/cdo.asp#:~:text=A%20collateralized%20debt%20obligation%20(CDO)%20is%20a%20complex%20structured%20finance,derived%20from%20another%20underlying%20asset) )).\n\nCDS: Credit Default Swap; in short, it's insurance against a value of a security in case its value drops. It works by taking out a policy against a security and paying somebody else to take the risk of its valuation falling. This risk is taken off your shoulders, by you paying the other party a premium to maintain the insurance policy (i.e. you hedge against your securities dropping in value). As such, the value of the security you are insuring is safe if you keep up your premium payments, insuring you against risk. Furthermore, if you choose to exercise your insurance, as the value of the security falls, you are paid out your insured amount; if the value of the security rises and you choose to close out\/exercise, you will take that loss + premiums ([https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/creditdefaultswap.asp#:\\~:text=A%20credit%20default%20swap%20(CDS)%20is%20a%20financial%20derivative%20or,with%20that%20of%20another%20investor.&amp;text=To%20swap%20the%20risk%20of,the%20case%20the%20borrower%20defaults](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/creditdefaultswap.asp#:~:text=A%20credit%20default%20swap%20(CDS)%20is%20a%20financial%20derivative%20or,with%20that%20of%20another%20investor.&amp;text=To%20swap%20the%20risk%20of,the%20case%20the%20borrower%20defaults) ).\n\nDark pools: Dark pools are exchange forums that replicate open stock exchanges, closed off to the public designed to hide institutional trading intent. In other words, by Gary Gensler himself, dark pools are designed to lack regulation, transparency and the light of transparency must be shone upon them ([https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/dark-pool.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/dark-pool.asp) ).\n\nAs definitions have been established let us quickly reiterate the chain of events in 2008, and Gary Gensler's response as the CFTC chairman; and how he dealt with dark pools before (meme stock synthetic shares are in dark pools I would speculate):\n\nBanks relax loan requirements to make cash of interest and mortgages-&gt; package those into bonds --&gt; package those into CDO's --&gt; market them as a great investment, while the underlying bonds are absolute garbage (this became garbage around 2006) --&gt; Michael Burry and co notice this and take CDS on them --&gt; wait 2 years, 08 roles around --&gt; the market corrects itself violently where CDS are basically used to wipe out mortgage CDO's; these transactions occur in dark pools, away from the public eye; all the while like right now the media say everything is absolutely fine, you should totally hold onto your mortgage and get it refinanced (sell your meme stocks today, the squeeze is definitely over, you should totally believe us).\n\nThus, the unregulated swaps market split over into the real economy and exposed everyday Americans to real risk (with meme stocks it\u2019s reversed, the shorter are at real risk right now).\n\nIn comes Gary Gensler and the Dodd-Frank Act: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gary\\_Gensler](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gary_Gensler) .\n\nDue to the crash, the Dodd-Frank Act was designed to curb excessive market abuses and speculation due to the lack of transparency from dark pools\u2014it had 3 main goals according to the prospective SEC chairman ([https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?304711-1\/financial-regulations-consumer-protection](https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?304711-1\/financial-regulations-consumer-protection) , [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp) ):\n\ni) Bring transparency and competition to swap dark pools\n\nii) Lower risk\n\niii) Increase market integrity\n\nAs such, according to Gensler, 90% of unregulated swaps and futures were brought from dark pools and mandated to use clearinghouses, so position data could be marked real-time for the public to view.\n\nFurthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act established several other protections ([https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp) ), these are as follows:\n\ni) Protections against the formation of too big to fail institutions (so Citadel can fail, and everybody will be fine hypothetically), as a failure of any one of them, could negatively affect the US economy.\n\nii) The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), established under Dodd-Frank also worked to curb predatory mortgage lending, deterring high commission mortgage brokers from closing high-interest loans with high fees; stopping the feedback loop of bad loans being dished out in exchange for high commissions, fees, and interest. It also protects consumers from excessive credit and debit card fees and interest, by my understanding ([https:\/\/www.govinfo.gov\/content\/pkg\/PLAW-111publ203\/pdf\/PLAW-111publ203.pdf](https:\/\/www.govinfo.gov\/content\/pkg\/PLAW-111publ203\/pdf\/PLAW-111publ203.pdf) ).\n\niii) Volcker Rule: It restricts banks investing in speculative trading and eliminates proprietary trading ([https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/proprietarytrading.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/proprietarytrading.asp)); moreover, banks are not allowed to be involved with hedge funds or private equity firms considered to be too risky; lastly, to minimize possible conflicts of interest, financial firms aren't allowed to trade proprietarily without sufficient \"skin in-game\". Furthermore, the Volcker Rule: \"regulates financial firms' use of derivatives to prevent \"too big to fail\" institutions from taking large risks that might wreak havoc on the broader economy\" (Citadel may be intimately familiar with this).\n\niv) Whistle-blower Program: The Dodd-Frank Act also goes ahead and strengthened and expanded the whistleblower program. As such it specifically established a mandatory bounty program (you heard that right, if you hunt down a shill spreading \"insider information\", that alludes to collusion or any other illegal activities, you get a big fat reward). I'll let the text from Investopedia take this one here:\n\n\"Specifically, it established a mandatory bounty program under which whistleblowers can receive from 10% to 30% of the proceeds from a litigation settlement, broadened the scope of a covered employee by including employees of a company's subsidiaries and affiliates, and extended the statute of limitations under which whistleblowers can bring forward a claim against their employer from 90 to 180 days after a violation is discovered\".\n\nMeaning, you as a whistleblower can receive up to 30% of the litigation settlement amount if you can provide concrete evidence of collusion (we'll expand on naked short fines in a bit after the in-depth dive through dark pools as promised.); so if you have proven insider information, happy hunting: [https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/whistleblower\/frequently-asked-questions#:\\~:text=Under%20the%20program%20eligible%20whistleblowers,regulatory%20and%20law%20enforcement%20authorities](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/whistleblower\/frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=Under%20the%20program%20eligible%20whistleblowers,regulatory%20and%20law%20enforcement%20authorities) .\n\nLastly, to end this section I'll leave the actual Dodd-Frank Act here in case any legal scholars are reading this and would like to dissect this: [https:\/\/www.govinfo.gov\/content\/pkg\/PLAW-111publ203\/pdf\/PLAW-111publ203.pdf](https:\/\/www.govinfo.gov\/content\/pkg\/PLAW-111publ203\/pdf\/PLAW-111publ203.pdf) .\n\nNow going back to the man who enforced this and brought the banks and other bad financial actors under control the last time by busting these dark pools, Gary Gensler. If Gary Gensler is appointed, and if these hedge funds have their short positions in dark pools to dupe the consumer; they will not only be breaking a litany of federal financial regulation laws. Furthermore, the SEC, DTTC, and hedge funds\/institutions long on meme stocks (Blackrock) have already started swimming around sensing blood in the water, once Gary Gensler comes in, based on his previous behavior of effectively curb-stomping illegal actors into submission, I can see him litigating Citadel and co (if they are guilty) out of existence and forcing them to close like he did last time as the Future's chairman.\n\n\\*Recap for Apes\\*\n\nSo let us recap, swaps and dark pools were used in 2008 to insure against the financial collapse created by the greed of financial institutions. The reason why we haven't had an exact repeat of 2008 is because of the Dodd-Frank Act; and the enforcer that took out Wall Street Gary Gensler is going to be running the SEC during meme stock chaos; which means the shorts lose their friends in high places that haven't been enforcing the rules.\n\nFrom here on we shall take a deep dive into how dark pools work, then talk about the hypothetical legal implications of shorter being caught with illegal naked shorts in dark pools; so, let us begin.\n\n\\---DARK POOL SECTION FOR APES---\n\nDark Pools for the layman are exchanges off of exchanges. A growing problem that brokers and retail investors noticed is that if a lot of small-scale orders are going through a relatively large and complicated fee system, for instance with the NYSE ([https:\/\/www.nyse.com\/publicdocs\/nyse\/markets\/nyse\/NYSE\\_Price\\_List.pdf](https:\/\/www.nyse.com\/publicdocs\/nyse\/markets\/nyse\/NYSE_Price_List.pdf) ).\n\nBoth retail and broker-dealers have issues with this due to a convoluted pricing model; if a certain threshold of clients is reached, internal off-exchange trades can begin\u2014this is the basis for a dark pool. Morgan Stanley ([https:\/\/www.morganstanley.com\/disclosures\/morgan-stanley-dark-pools](https:\/\/www.morganstanley.com\/disclosures\/morgan-stanley-dark-pools) ), Goldman Sachs ([https:\/\/www.thetradenews.com\/guide\/goldman-sachs-sigma-x\/](https:\/\/www.thetradenews.com\/guide\/goldman-sachs-sigma-x\/)  ) and of course Citadel ([https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-citadel-darkpool-idUSKBN0MN22Q20150327](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-citadel-darkpool-idUSKBN0MN22Q20150327) , closed in 2015 after harsher reporting requirements, go figure), all have dark pools.\n\nThis creates a buffer of exchanges, as shares circulating in dark pools can fulfill buy and sell orders to 100% outside of the exchange during normal trading activity.\n\nHowever, any buffer can be used as an amplifier. As such if a hedge fund wants to make a quick profit by shorting a stock, they lend as many shares as possible; dump them on an exchange and watch as the retail investor tries to \u201ccut their losses''; while spreading FUD by calling in the media, till even the least sophisticated investor sells. As volatility spikes, smart money comes in and the shorts are covered in a dark pool. This allows you to buy shares on a downward momentum, influencing the price immediately on the open exchange. The reverse works for long positions as well, if you would like to dump it at a profit, just sell it off in a dark pool. Cramer admitted to part of the process in an interview ([https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jIfixbq\\_u0Q](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jIfixbq_u0Q)), on the dark pools, while not mentioned, it is certainly part of the process.\n\nAn illustrate how this might work in an example:\n\nCompany A wants to acquire company B ASAP by buying up let's say 30% of shares of company B. Company A, therefore, goes to market maker M to buy shares for them. M then proceeds to start buying shares on the exchange to drive the price up a bit.\n\nMeanwhile, they try to buy up as many shares from the dark pools as possible, to not drive the price up on the open exchange. The price on the exchange usually reflects in the dark pools, but not vice versa (because people look at the exchange prices, shortages in dark pools only show after a slight delay).\n\nIf you were to say that a purchase of 5% of the float would drive up the price of shares from B up by 5%, that would mean that after the buy the price would be 30% higher with around 15% higher than the start price average.\n\nThat is if people were not to start day trading the shares, which probably will happen.\n\nHowever: if you were to do the same thing with dark pools you suddenly see that while the price on the exchange goes up, M is suddenly able to buy shares from places that do not influence the share price.\n\nAgain, a 5% purchase on the open market equals a 5% price increase. If 10% can be covered over the dark pools, only 20% affects share price, leaving us with an average of about 10% higher than starting price.\n\nThis is 5% that was \"saved\" for M and A. M obviously wants a small fee for the service totaling 2%, which leaves A with around 3% saved.\n\nThat 5% came from the retail investor that was not aware of the movements in the dark pools. It costs the retail investor money. It robs you of your 30% gain in that scenario and gives you 20% instead. It costs you.\n\nRemember Crammer stated sentiment is key in pulling the stunt off: ([https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r07Gg92YjOI](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r07Gg92YjOI) )? It would be exponentially by simply getting the order flow, as such sentiment can be deduced without any bias. This allows the fund to take opposites of trades by going short negating buying pressure, either in dark pools or exchanges, as well as directing how the orders get executed. This possible order execution delay has been brought up in Congress ([https:\/\/youtu.be\/RNgzOr-m6ok?t=89](https:\/\/youtu.be\/RNgzOr-m6ok?t=89) ). This amounts to a hedge fund\/ moneymaker being able to make a small money printer for themselves (Citadel), which we can confidently speculate exits. Furthermore, if Citadel doesn\u2019t like your decision to buy, they can simply take the other side of the trade giving you a shorted share.\n\nThis is where Citadel and CFD trading comes in:\n\nUsing dark pools, Citadel as a market maker could in theory capitalize on such scenarios massively; furthermore, until 2015 they ran their own dark pool, called Apogee ([https:\/\/www.iotafinance.com\/en\/Detail-view-MIC-code-CDED.html](https:\/\/www.iotafinance.com\/en\/Detail-view-MIC-code-CDED.html) ) which was decommissioned in 2015 possibly due to increased reporting\/transparency requirements ([https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-citadel-darkpool-idUSKBN0MN22Q20150327](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-citadel-darkpool-idUSKBN0MN22Q20150327) ).\n\nBy operating Apogee, however, Citadel as a market maker was able to capitalize on such scenarios massively. Since then, Citadel switched to Citadel Connect, which does not qualify as an alternative trading system requiring no reporting.\n\nThe best-case scenario for Citadel, if they wanted to short a stock would be to not have shares involved at all or making a contract for difference with you; this means you make an agreement with Citadel to get the current share price at any time you like from them, without ever having to buy or sell the shares. This kind of trading is heavily regulated, however, thus not common. However, they have engaged in similar tactics: naked shorting.\n\nUnder Reg SHO 203 b 2 iii ([https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/cfr\/text\/17\/242.203](https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/cfr\/text\/17\/242.203) ) market makers are allowed to short a security under a bona fide agreement, meaning without ill intent. As such, to naked short a stock, good faith is pretended to be in effect, from there they buy naked calls from another party they control (Citadel LLC in this case). From here, the equivalent amount of shares are lent out to either \"Citadel LLC\" or any other party, which are then dumped on the open market. After 3 days, since the \u201cshares\u201d never existed on the open exchange, becoming FTD\u2019s. As FTD status is reached, they simply go to a shell company or \u201cRobinhood\u201d and write ITM call options, exercise them, replacing FTD-IOUs with the ones from the shell. As these reach FTD, the reverse happens, as Citadel IOUs replace ones from their shell. Repeat to infinity and a stock price can be crashed by printing shares faster than the Feds print money (these shares will quickly add up dark pools though and need to be cleared). As institutions bailout, only retail would remain, if retail has no strategy on the security, a run by retail to get rid of the bag happens.\n\nNow what I've said may sound despairing and should get you angry, however, I believe this cycle has almost been crushed, due to apes buying and holding. Allow me to present to you this diagram (the link below contains a flow chart of how dark pools operate within the market):\n\n[https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-darkpool-methods.html](https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-darkpool-methods.html)\n\nAs shown, they can use synthetic share production mechanisms, blatantly creating synthetic shares in a dark pool as a market maker (citadel runs it), making phantom shares using calls, Failure to Delivers, explicit naked shorting (creating IOU's), etc. (there are tons of illegal production mechanisms, most of which we're covered in my old DD's and a quick recap example above. Once they have determined which method they'll use, they target the security, and the flowchart begins. If they use the dark pools, they can theoretically create an infinite number of synthetic shares (they'd have to buy infinite real shares to buy though to cover though if they are a) caught with synthetics or b) get margin called).\n\nApes for the last months have been buying up all synthetics and creating price floors as you've seen, a hedge fund at this point has 2 choices; cover all the shares (the smart choice), or digging themselves in the hole deeper hoping you will sell creating FUD (Reddit\/discord infiltration will tell you when their getting desperate); so they can finally cover, as such if investors keep buying and holding, either more rocket fuel gets added to the rocket or they cover; either-or, doesn't matter what anybody else says.\n\nLastly here's a list of dark pools that I found that have existed in \"the state of play\", back in 2014, I apologize I couldn't find any more recent data:\n\n[https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/bbm%3A978-1-137-44957-3%2F1.pdf](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/bbm%3A978-1-137-44957-3%2F1.pdf) ; (FYI Goldman Sachs has one, and they just got margin called for context: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mP4yaoQll7I](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mP4yaoQll7I)  (if your r\/wsb YouTube links aren't allowed for sources sorry) due to Bill Hwang)\n\n\\*Recap for Apes\\*\n\nNow let\u2019s recap, the SEC chairman Gary Gensler is well versed in bringing swaps out of dark pools which caused the last crash and is coming in during the point of the SEC during a speculative short squeeze that will top all other short squeezes in human history (in my speculative opinion), This may cause the greatest wealth transfer in history.\n\nThe elites from any society would not like this as it would mean, their status would be tarnished; as such they will resort to any amount of financial war crimes to try to make sure that doesn't happen. However, during the last financial war (2008), Gary Gensler came in and enforced the rules congress passed, this time he's coming in again. I believe he will enforce the rules and bring justice to these financial war crimes again as shown by his record; as such before that happens you will see FUD intensifying (which is already happening, expect more of this); as such if you've been in the game this long, you should know the drill by now.\n\n\\---LEGALITIES FOR APES---\n\nLet\u2019s talk legal; if Citadel as a market maker is using order flow, dark pools, and synthetic shares to balloon to the height of being too big to fail, they violate a half dozen federal laws and policies, targeting you the consumer. Let\u2019s go over them (I'm a physicist by training, not a legal expert so I'll link the laws and tell you guys my speculation and let legal experts handle it):\n\nSources for these laws are coded in this link (I apologize there's a 40k reddit field limit):\n\n[https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-legal-sources-for-apes.html](https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-legal-sources-for-apes.html)\n\nAs stated above, I am no legal expert; however, I will tell you of my understanding of them based on the sources I have read, any legal expert reading this is; feel free to correct me and post them in the comment section below (I want a specific rebuttal based on the legal text though, your co-operation is appreciated).\n\nIf a market maker like Citadel, or any other firm that has shorted meme stocks, uses dark pools, collusion, and synthetic shares to try and dupe retail investors that simply \"like the stock\" and are buying and holding, by my understanding they violate:\n\ni) Anti-collusion and market manipulation laws: By working together with other institutions they are colluding and manipulating the price, that simple.\n\nii) Naked shorting: Borrowing a security that doesn't exist to shorting is straight-up illegal, and if you are caught using naked shorts the fines can range from $5,128 - $14,887 (USD) per naked short (sources are given in the naked shorting section).\n\niii) Synthetic share creation: This in my opinion would qualify as a naked short and market manipulation; as not only are you shorting a share that doesn't exist, you are manipulating the market so the price goes down by diluting supply, which also illegal.\n\niv) SHO rule violations: From the SEC: Regulation SHO requires broker-dealers to identify a source of borrowable stock before executing a short sale in any equity security to reduce the number of situations where stock is unavailable for settlement ([https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/investor\/pubs\/regsho.htm#:\\~:text=Regulation%20SHO%20requires%20broker%2Ddealers,stock%20is%20unavailable%20for%20settlement](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/investor\/pubs\/regsho.htm#:~:text=Regulation%20SHO%20requires%20broker%2Ddealers,stock%20is%20unavailable%20for%20settlement) ) ; as such if a broker-dealer cannot identify the source of a stock, before a short sale, it\u2019s illegal.\n\nv) Dodd-Frank Act violations: If Hedge funds are found colluding with each other to rig the market using short shares to become too big to fail, that violates the Dodd-Frank Act as it is explicitly designed to stop according to you guess it Gary Gensler the new incoming SEC chairman.\n\nvi) Insider Trading Laws: Trading based on non-public information; in my opinion, this is blatantly illegal as such the debate is black and white; thus illegal.\n\nvii) Order flow payment: The SEC and Congress are currently debating whether order flow payment is legal in the first place; we shall see what conclusion they come to.\n\nThis is all I've found so far, but if you find any more illegalities please go ahead and comment down below.\n\nWrapping up these financial war crimes (their war crimes, because they are explicitly designed to hurt the innocent; retail investors). If Citadel is using synthetic shares to make itself too big to fail hypothetically it would break anti-collusion laws, the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibition against naked shorting, SHO rules, prohibition of Market manipulation, insider trading, etc. (lawyers have at it); as such, if they are caught, would be facing legal and financial extinction (of course this is just speculation by a dude on the internet, confirm it for yourself; if this is true however and can be proven in court, I believe it can be constituted as a financial war crime and should be dealt with accordingly). Furthermore, if you have insider information proving this, you by the Dodd-Frank Act's whistleblower program are entitled to up to 30% of the settlement amount, so happy hunting apes.\n\nIf you are reading this on r\/wallstreetbets (if this gets on there) this is as far as I can go without it violating the new rules, due to the subreddit\u2019s size; as such, I thank you for reading my work,\n\nList of additional sources:\n\n[https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-additional-sources.html](https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-additional-sources.html)\n\nThanks for your attention, and I hope you have a wonderful day; none of this was financial advice, and purely opinion based on the sources given for entertainment purposes. Lastly, I am not a cat, and like the stock.\n\nIf you are still here, this is for subreddits other than r\/wsb. We shall begin the meme stonk section for both GME and AMC; let\u2019s dive in:\n\n\\---MEME STONK SECTION---\n\nI apologize this isn\u2019t on reddit, however it has an absurd 40kb strict limit: as such I have coded back up links: [https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-meme-stonk-section.html](https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-meme-stonk-section.html)  .\n\nWithin this link you shall find the full extent of the darkpool arguments and memestonks, as well as evidence of 4.6 billion, and 630 million synthetic shares of GME and AMC circulating in darkpools, while entertaining the idea that this is simply just 1 darkpool, using empirical evidence to show it is not the only one; I hope you enjoy it (This is also my first time modularly coding together blog pieces, so feedback would be appreciated)([https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/amcstock\/comments\/mbuti6\/another\\_sighting\\_of\\_that\\_possible\\_4\\_billion\\_share\/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&amp;utm\\_source=share](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/amcstock\/comments\/mbuti6\/another_sighting_of_that_possible_4_billion_share\/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) , [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/mcpyid\/after\\_exposing\\_the\\_525\\_million\\_shares\\_in\\_the\\_otc\/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&amp;utm\\_source=share](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/mcpyid\/after_exposing_the_525_million_shares_in_the_otc\/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) ).\n\nGoing forward this will be a 3 part series for AMC, and 2 part series for GME; you beautiful apes have held so far despite all this and you my friends have nothing but my highest respects, I believe your efforts will be rewarded with Martian tendies sooner rather than later.\n\nQuickly touching on the next piece FUD: the desperation of shorts, will consist of me addressing \"mUh gOvErNmEnT wIlL iNtErVeNe aT 500 #trustmysourcesbro\", share dilution (in my opinion will not happen, it's a ploy to get the share recounts), the squeeze not happening (total FUD cause math). As DFV said, hang in there, helps on the way.\n\nRecap apes; firstly the crucial point is they most likely owe more than 10x float on AMC, and 13x float on GME hence they're desperate, they are resorting to financial war crimes breaking a dozen laws trying to prevent you from picking up your tendie orders, this happened in 2008 and in case anything drastic happens, memestonks are your insurance and you will more than likely have your insurance policy be exercised, all the mathematical indicators for a squeeze are there, now it's just a when, dark pools are designed to hide the truth and hide intent, and because of those synthetic shares in these pools, they are most likely panicking; lastly when this squeezes, you holds you apes hold all the cards, and you, not the institutions, you determine how this timeline and the future plays out.\n\n\\---HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY---\n\nA lot has been covered, let\u2019s summarize. This is a repeat of 2008, but this time we hold the insurance policies, in case this moons. The similarities are quite startling, from the SEC chairman Gary Gensler coming to bust this down, them using dark pools to screw the average person out of tendies, committing financial war crimes in broad daylight to shake apes. Furthermore, the dark pools explicitly showing both meme stocks have been naked shorted by at least 10x, this squeeze is mathematically confirmed, and we are looking at a fallout, how big the fallout will be depends on how big the hole they dug themselves with these dark pools; but in any case, apes hold the insurance policies so I believe we should be chilling, and if we continue to buy and hold we are simply buying more insurance for stonks we like. As such to sum it up in one sentence, their hiding in dark pools, Gary Gensler is starting the hunt and we have the insurance policies.\n\n\\---What you can look forward to in this series--\n\nAs stated above, this series will diverge into 2 hyper focused parts; one GME focused, another one AMC focused. The AMC series will be:\n\ni) Dance of Darkness: The SEC and Dark Pools\n\nii) FUD: the desperation of shorts\n\niii) AMC the climb to 10k and battle of 12008.01\n\nGME:\n\ni) Dance of Darkness: The SEC and Dark Pools.\n\nii) GME, the journey too Olympus Mons.\n\n\\---TLDR---\n\nThey\u2019re hiding in dark pools and using ETFs, naked shorting and synthetic shorting to manipulate the market hoping people will sell so they can exit the feedback loop as illustrated; there are most likely multiple dark pools with synthetic shares hence their desperation (+ their overleveraged). These memestocks have become swaps (CDS's: Credit Default Swaps), and those who hold them hold insurance against any financial disturbance. The longer this manipulation continues, the larger the correction will most likely be.\n\nLastly, I\u2019d like to offer you two links, that I had to develop due to reddit\u2019s archaic code (best crowd communication technology we have so far though):\n\ni) [https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-thesec-and-dark-pools.html](https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-thesec-and-dark-pools.html)\n\nii) [https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-sec-and-darkpools.html](https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-sec-and-darkpools.html)\n\nIn those links, you will find the unaltered cuts of this DD, the first one is edited; however, the Snyder Cut is as raw as it gets. I hope you enjoy them\n\n\\---Final Commentary and Thanks---\n\nThank you for sticking with me and going through this rather long article, the reason why I keep this article long and extensive is because I believe in transparency and integrity. I believe all data should be put on the table, for the reader to determine what they should make of it. I don\u2019t believe in hiding data and guiding people, I believe the average retail person is best suited in making choices that affect their future, as such the data should be transparent and visible. Moving forward, these articles will remain extensive and mathematical in nature; to bring transparency and integrity to the marketplace. Furthermore, I understand there is a lot of FUD floating around on meme stocks, these articles serve as papers that bring transparency, as they are designed to investigate memestonks.\n\nI understand there\u2019s a lot of FUD going around, as such I usually don\u2019t ask much other than a request that you give me feedback and try to break my thesis in the comment section below; however, this time I will ask you to share this on your favorite social media (mine is stockwits) using #DanceofDarkness. I believe a lot of people will benefit from market integrity and transparency so thank you in advance for sharing this. I hope it helps a lot of apes; and as DFV, during congressional testimony, alluded to Hang in there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a quick quote to encapsulate the entire article in my opinion: \"You will never do anything in this world without courage. It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor\"\u2014Aristotle.\n\nFinally, to reiterate here's a quick hashtag you may use if you feel like using social media to make this article spread fast: #DanceofDarkness; and the original cuts are as follows:\n\ni) [https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-thesec-and-dark-pools.html](https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-thesec-and-dark-pools.html)\n\nii) [https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-sec-and-darkpools.html](https:\/\/ddextension68.blogspot.com\/2021\/04\/dance-of-darkness-sec-and-darkpools.html)\n\nLegal Disclaimer: None of this was or is financial advice, this is purely speculative opinion based on the sources as presented in this article\u2014as such, it should be both viewed as and taken for entertainment purposes (i.e. the entertainment of ideas).

{"question":"Early 20s with no skills on paper\u2026 am I trapped? Where do I even begin.\n\nI\u2019m currently 24 and have recently (3 months ago) changed jobs to what I thought was going to be a much better chance at a career with progression.\n\nFor context, I have no degree\/any actual useful skills on paper. \n\nI spent the last 4 years working at a minimum wage customer facing retail job (storage company) which had monthly bonuses too but they weren\u2019t guaranteed. I hated the job and was severely overworked and underpaid\/not appreciated. \n\nI finally built up the courage to make a change for myself and applied for lots of \u201cbetter\u201d jobs. I got an interview and took the job as it sounded great and was offering more money (after the first 6 months probation) than my previous dead end job.\n\nAll started well, but 3 months in I have realised I cannot perform well in this role. It\u2019s a high paced sales role making outbound phone calls to sell insurance. I essentially am sitting at home (WFH) for 7.5 hours saying the same sentences over and over and over again. It\u2019s so mentally draining.\n\nI\u2019ve been looking for other jobs online but cannot find anything as I\u2019m coming to the realisation that I am a pretty useless person when it comes to work. I have no qualifications other than school. No relevant experience in any decent sectors of work. \n\nI currently rent with my girlfriend (\u00a31050 pcm + all other bills) she earns more than I do currently but wouldn\u2019t be able to pay everything on her own.\n\nThis has made me feel so useless and stuck. For my own mental health I feel like I need to leave this current job as every day is getting harder and harder for me to take it. My problem is that if I do quit, it could take me months to find another (better?) job again and even then it\u2019s likely going to be the same kind of job due to my limited skills. \n\nAt this point I am genuinely feeling so trapped in my situation that it is making me want to end it all. \n\nHow can I progress career wise or at least get my foot in the door in a decent working industry? \n\nIt feels like my destiny is full of retail jobs with no skill needed or \u201csales\u201d jobs where my only \u2018skill\u2019 is having a voice to read a script with. \n\nTbh I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019ve even written all of this out but any advice at all would be appreciated.\n\n*EDIT* Wow thank you so much everyone, I really appreciate all of the responses.

{"question":"After a decade of no growth, does the property culture differ on the West Coast? Hi there. I'm a Sydneysider who's curious to hear from any Perth-ians (Perthites? I don't know what the term is) about what the \"property culture\" is like over there. \n\nn Sydney, it seems that every bastard is constantly talking about property (and yes I fully realise the irony of this post). Going to a BBQ and saying that you're a renter who's happy renting because it doesn't seem worth the price to buy is like going to Saudi Arabia and saying that you think Muhammad is just okay. Do you remember when Bitcoin hit $20,000USD and it felt like everyone was talking about it, from Reddit, to the news, to your friends, to your boomer parents? That's how I feel about real estate all the time. The assumption that it's always the right decision to buy anything, no matter what is is, seems to be the prevailing one. Even the people who are prophesying huge property crashes, I get the vibe they're only doing so because they want to buy a property themselves (and get on \"the ladder\"), rather than anything else.\n\nIn Sydney, the price of houses has gone nowhere but up for the past 30 odd years (save for a few temporary bumps here and there) which means that the popular theory that property ALWAYS goes up (by a lot) is hard to argue against, whereas I know that this have not been the case on the West Coast. \n\nI'm curious if this annoying facet of what I've always considered Australian culture is there in WA after a decade largely without price growth?","answer":"It's certainly different here. We get the same ABC news coverage that's constantly mentioning how unaffordable housing is and it's a bit confusing. Confusing because a lot of young West Aussie have bought or built cheaply, $400k or much less gets you a 3\/4x2. You can go much cheaper than that even but you'll get a poorly built breadbox. The same age demographic that can afford in WA, is complaining on the other side of the country that they can't get into home ownership. Plenty of my friends have bought and some are renting. What's interesting is your average $350-450k home rents and mortgage payments can be awfully close to the same if you're buying with a decent deposit. There's still a lot of the older generations invested in housing with the impression that it will always go up. Even when prices are going down, \"Don't worry, it will bounce back any minute.\" Think that culture is ingrained in the older Aussie generations."}
{"question":"Told my insurance would cover blood test for $15, now getting bill from collection agency for $221 I went to the doc months ago for a pain and they wanted to do some blood work just in case, I was specifically told I was covered on the entire process and it would only cost me ~$15 for the blood work.\n\nNow I'm getting a bill from the diagnostics lab and apparently a collections agency has taken it. What options do I have? \n\nEdit: The collection notice lists the $221 charge from 8\/31, and on my billing statement from the doctor's office I have an outstanding balance of $28 from 8\/31, but I won't be able to contact the lab until Monday.\n\n08\/31\/2017 OFFICE OR OTHER OUTPATIENT VISIT FOR THE\nEVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF XXXX\n$95.00\n\n09\/13\/2017 Insurance Payment: BCBS-SC Processed -$42.44\n\n09\/13\/2017 Insurance Adjustment: BCBS-SC Processed -$24.28\n\nPatient Balance - Coinsurance $28.28\n\n\nEdit part 2: Collection's agency has informed me the bill stemmed from my insurance declining paying for the lab work. I guess my next option is to dispute it with the insurance company. \n\nI appreciate the advice, everyone. \n\nEdit part 3: The lab my blood was sent to definitely accepts my insurance. Thank you all for the insight, I'm still reading everything. ","answer":"I work in medical billing. You need to find the EOB for the DOS with the lab, not the doctor.\n\nPhysician, hospital, anesthesia, radiology, and lab work services are all usually different billing offices. It\u2019s entirely possible that your coinsurance you\u2019re looking at was for the physician bill and this denied bill that has since gone to collections is for lab work which would be a completely separate office.\n\nWhat you do is call the insurance first. See why they denied it. It might be a coding issue, ask specifically about that. If it\u2019s not, you\u2019re SOL and you\u2019ll just owe the money. Again, lab work is different from physician billing so even if you say you were told it would be covered it will just amount to \u201csorry, I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\u201d Regardless on whether you can review coding or the denial is legitimate, the next step is to call the lab billing office. Review if they sent you statements. If you\u2019re in collections that means they\u2019ve billed you at least twice. Some offices send balances to collections after two bills, some after four, and some never do. Review that they sent it to the correct address. If they did, it sucks, but unfortunately you will owe this balance to collections \u2014 even if you never got the bills for some reason. If they didn\u2019t \u2014 if something was wrong with the address and you never got the bill, dispute that it\u2019s in collections so you can pay the office directly. If you\u2019re successful with your dispute, you can then ask for any discounts, hardships, charity care, or payment arrangement options for your bill. \n\nA secret is that not all collections agencies report your credit. If this one does, and you were successful in disputing the balance in collections and so the office removed it so you can pay them directly, ask if you can file an appeal to remove that ding from your credit report. If it doesn\u2019t, then it\u2019s like nothing ever happened.\n\nLet me know if there\u2019s anything else I can help you with.\n\nEdit: This just occurred to me. Ask for a reference number for every conversation you have. Insurance, billing, collections. That way if insurance says they\u2019ll cover because the coding was wrong and so the lab files a claim with the corrected coding you can dispute it if the insurance denies again. Or if the office said they\u2019ll do something, you can hold them accountable. If you don\u2019t get a reference number, ask for the person\u2019s name and notate the date as well."}

{"question":"I bought $1000 worth of the Top Ten Cryptos on January 1st, 2019 (July 2019 Update) &amp;#x200B;\n\n[EXPERIMENT - Tracking Top 10 Cryptocurrencies of 2019 - Month Seven - UP 74&amp;#37;](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/qaguli943ne31.png)\n\n[Full blog post](https:\/\/www.publish0x.com\/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments\/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-2019-month-seven-xknveq)\n\ntl;dr - July was a down month, but still up +74% in 2019. Bitcoin wins the month, overall Litecoin holds the smallest of leads, all cryptos in positive territory for the year except Stellar and XRP.\n\n# The Experiment:\n\nInstead of hypothetically tracking cryptos,[\u00a0I made an actual $1000 investment, $100 in each of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap as of the 1st of January 2018](https:\/\/www.publish0x.com\/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments\/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xomekw).\u00a0***I then repeated the experiment on the 1st of January 2019***. Think of it as a lazy man's Index Fund (no weighting or rebalancing), less technical, more fun (for me at least), and hopefully still a proxy for the market as a whole - or at the very least an interesting snapshot of the 2019 crypto space. Trying to keep it simple and accessible for beginners and those looking to get into crypto but maybe not quite ready to jump in yet.\n\n# The Rules:\n\nBuy $100 of each the Top 10 cryptocurrencies on January 1st, 2019. Run the experiment two years. Hold only. No selling. No trading. Report monthly. Compare loosely to the\u00a0[2018 Top Ten Experiment](https:\/\/www.publish0x.com\/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments\/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xomekw).\n\n# Month Seven - Up 74%\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/q1zu3e4m3ne31.png\n\nJuly hit the 2019 Top Ten portfolio hard, with a nearly -40% drop since the end of June. All cryptos are in the red except\u00a0**Bitcoin and Tether**. June showed sideways movement, but July decisively breaks the five month win streak (or more preciously, a four-month-win-plus-one-month-sideways streak). That said, the 2019 Top Ten portfolio is still up +74% on the year.\n\n# Ranking\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/dsoc7m9u3ne31.png\n\nLots of movement this month. All of the Top Ten cryptos moved except\u00a0**Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple**. Of note,\u00a0**Litecoin**\u00a0and\u00a0**Bitcoin Cash**\u00a0which switched places with each other again,\u00a0**Stellar**\u00a0reclaimed its spot in the Top Ten, and\u00a0**EOS**\u00a0dropped two spots to #8.\n\n**Tron**\u00a0is now alone as the only Top Ten dropout and has been replaced by\u00a0**Binance Coin**.\n\n***July Winners***\u00a0\\-\u00a0**Bitcoin**, easily. All others (except\u00a0**Tether**) were down double digits, with most falling over -20%.\n\n***July Losers***\u00a0\\-\u00a0**Tron**, easily, losing nearly 1\/3rd of its value, down -32% in July.\u00a0**EOS**\u00a0had a rough month too, dropping -26% and two places in the rankings.\n\nFor those keeping score, here is tally of which coins have the most monthly wins and loses during the first seven months of this experiment:\u00a0**Bitcoin**\u00a0distinguished itself from the pack this month by achieving its second monthly victory of the year.\u00a0**Bitcoin SV**\u00a0still has the most monthly loses: three out of the first seven months.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/mbqz58n04ne31.png\n\n# Overall update \u2013 Litecoin holds the smallest of leads, all cryptos in positive territory except Stellar and Ripple\n\nSimilar to last month, although\u00a0**Bitcoin**\u00a0makes the headlines, it's actually\u00a0**Litecoin**\u00a0that continues to perform best, up +214% on the year. My initial $100 investment in\u00a0**Litecoin**\u00a0is now worth $321. But for the second month in a row,\u00a0**Bitcoin**\u00a0made up a ton of ground, finishing July just a few percentage points behind\u00a0**Litecoin**.\n\n**Stellar**\u00a0is at the bottom, down -28% so far in 2019, followed by\u00a0**Ripple**, down -10%.\n\n# Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/y6pm81g64ne31.png\n\nFor the first time since February, the total crypto market cap decreased, losing about $13B in July. Still, the overall market cap remains over $300B, an increase of +143% since the beginning of 2019.\n\n# Bitcoin dominance:\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/79c40ey84ne31.png\n\n**Bitcoin** dominance leaped again in July, and now is close to 68%. This sets another record for **Bitcoin** dominance so far in the 2019 and[\u00a02018 Top Ten Experiments](https:\/\/www.publish0x.com\/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments\/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xomekw).\n\n# Overall return on investment from January 1st, 2019:\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/aizrumub4ne31.png\n\nIn July I saw my overall return shrink by about $400, quite a hit. If I cashed out today, my $1,000 initial investment would return $1,744, a +74% gain. Not at all bad compared to the stock market: the return I would have received from investing that same $1000 on January 1st, 2019 in the the S&amp;P 500 is about +17%, same as last month (see below).\n\n# Implications\/Observations:\n\nAlthough the overall market ended down on the month, it's still up 143% on the year. What's noteworthy this month is the absolute chasm that's opened between the performance of the market overall and the Top Ten cryptos that I started with at the beginning of 2019. My Top Ten group? Up 74%. That's only half the return of the overall market. Remember, in May, the gains from the Top Ten and the entire market were both exactly the same amount: +114%. This month, not even close. For two straight months, focusing only on the Top Ten has been a losing strategy. This is reminiscent of last year as\u00a0[at no point in the Top Ten 2018 Experiment did the Top Ten strategy outperform the overall market](https:\/\/www.publish0x.com\/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments\/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xomekw).\n\nI'm also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. The S&amp;P 500 was flat in July, still up +17% since the beginning of 2019. Solid gains, but of course nothing like what we've seen in crypto so far this year. The initial $1k investment I put into crypto would have yielded +$170 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P compared to the $744 I'm currently up with the 2019 Top Ten Cryptos.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/dalip23i4ne31.png\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nJuly was an obvious down month for crypto. I've been a bit delayed on the update this month so as I'm putting this together, crypto's been on a bit of an upward run, with **Bitcoin** looking like it's about to test $12k. The monthly nature of these updates prevents me from getting caught up in the daily fluctuations of the crypto market and allows a bit of perspective.\u00a0 Taking a step back, it looks, at this point at least, like July was a bit of a speedbump, but by no means signals a crypto bear market - the overall trend of the first half of 2019 is unmistakably positive.\n\nIf you're just finding this experiment now, here's the backstory: On the 1st of January, 2018, I bought $100 each of the Top Ten cryptos at the time for a total investment of $1000 to see how they would perform over the year. I tracked the experiment and reported each month. The result?\u00a0[I ended 2018 down -85%, my $1000 worth only $150.](https:\/\/www.publish0x.com\/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments\/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-for-one-year-2018-final-report-for-2018-down-85-xlol)\n\nAfter last year's experiment ended, I decided to do two things:\n\n1. Extend the Top Ten 2018 Crypto project one more year. The experiment is now in its 19th month. You can check out the latest update\u00a0[here](https:\/\/www.publish0x.com\/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments\/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xomekw).\n2.

{"question":"Why are price controls not seen as a legitimate way of dealing with current inflation issues? In most parts of the world, central banks are responding to inflation issues by increasing interest rates. To me, this seems to hit the middle and lower classes the hardest, by increasing their biggest expenses (mortgages). People can just buy less when products become expensive, but you can't really reduce loan payments without severe consequences.\n\nWhy don't central banks consider price controls, especially on less elastic goods like food, as a strategy for dealing with inflation? What am I missing? Also, are there any economists that do advocate for alternative solutions to increasing interest rates?","answer":"Changing interest rates ultimately changes supply and demand. To be precise, the goal is a downward shift of the demand curve.\n\nPrice controls don't change supply and demand, they only increase the quantity demanded and decrease the quantity supplied (movements along the demand curve, not of the curve itself), causing shortages."}
{"question":"inherited two houses worth 4 million euros (now 5,5-6), 3 million euros still in debt. hold or sell? Hello my dear r\/personalfinance redditors,\n\nFirst of all, I know that this is a big luxury problem and I am well aware of the privileged position we find ourselves in. Nevertheless, I would be grateful for serious comments with assessments from your side. Also, I'm German, living in Germany, where the houses are standing as well.\n\nInherited a semi-detached house together with a family member, built in 2020 for 4 million euros including land costs etc. Of this 1 million equity, 1 million loan 0.5% the first 10 years fixed rate and 2 million euro euribor loan with first adjustment in March '23.\n\nThe houses were value investments, the rental income would be about 250,000 euros gross per year.\nCurrently only the one house is rented, the tenants are very demanding, which is probably more than understandable with such a rent - but still can be very exhausting. In the other house, we are currently afraid of renting, because we are afraid of rent defaults - and thus expensive rent nomads. Apparently in the price range in the area it has happened more than once, because, for example, entrepreneurs went bankrupt and could no longer afford the rent.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, the houses had an increase in value of about 1.5-2 million euros.\n\nThere is no prepayment penalty for the loans. We still have liquid assets totaling about 1.5 million euros. With this, we could make a large unscheduled repayment, for example, should the euribor-linked loan interest rate - our main concern - go up sharply.\n\nAt the moment our net income is around 10,000\u20ac\/month in total. The people who can thus pay the rents in \"our\" houses on a monthly basis are in a different league financially, at least as far as the monthly cash flow is concerned.\n\nFor us, there are two options:\n\nA. We sell the houses, settle the loans, come out with maybe 2.5 million gross after settling the loans. Of this, about 700,000 \u20ac speculation tax must be paid (which would be omitted from 2030 after the expiry of the deadline), the remaining 1.8 million we divide by two, buy from it perhaps apartment with less rent default risk because higher diversification and rejoice in the money we have been awarded.\n\nB. We look for a tenant for the other house, use all the rental income to pay off the loan and build up reserves. If the euribor loan becomes too expensive for us, we take our own money to bring it down by unscheduled repayment.\nThis variant brings us the advantages of no speculation tax, if we hold the object still a few years as well as a very high rent yield (250.000\/4.000.000, over 6%) opposite the purchase price. Also, as new construction, the houses don't seem to have too high costs over the next few years (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nNow for my questions, are we missing something? Is the math too simplistic? What would you guys do in such an exceptional situation?\n\nAre grateful for any advice, any opinion.","answer":"Sounds like if you manage it correctly this is retirement quality income.  First of all, this advice is based on the US rental market\/laws, etc. My suggestions\n\n1. Refinance to a fixed interest rate if possible.  Even if rates a little high right now, the cost certainty is valuable, and you can refinance later when rates pull back.\n2. Get a really good property manager at least for the time being.  Have them help find a good tenant, rent out both houses and have the PM deal with the unfavorable tenant and guard against the \"rent nomads\" (I don't really know what this is)\n3. Try to learn about managing the property yourself, be proactive and involved.  Even with the current PM in place learn all you can.\n4. Then, at some point in the future, if you decide that you are willing to take on all the work (and headaches) you can try to manage the property yourself.  I, for one, would always have a property manager I just don't feel like it is worth the time and effort to self-manage.\n5. As others have mentioned, that speculation tax is huge.  I would bite the bullet and wait out the 10 years or whatever term is necessary to avoid paying it.  To be honest, this is literally, pretty much inflation-proof, lifetime income, I would hold on to it forever."}

That's actually pretty standard - As long as your net income to debt ratio is good, you should have an easy time getting a loan. \n\nYou can also use more exotic methods (Banks and credit unions mostly provide only conventional loans with very strict requirements). Talk to a good loan broker, they can get you loan offers from other types of lenders with more relaxed criteria. But with your $200k \/ year income, it should be easy for you to get a conventional loan with good interest rates (which are very low right now btw)."}
{"question":"My husband died suddenly and I\u2019m not sure what to do. My husband died suddenly on Saturday and I\u2019m not sure what to do. We have a mortgage, one car payment, boat payment, $8000 in CC debt, and he did have a small student loan balance. Between his ESOP and IRAs he has about $200,000.00 and we had a small life Insurance policy on him through my work of $12,000.\n\nI will be selling the house, boat, and one of the vehicles and I may just pay off all the cc debt, but I don\u2019t want to make any rash decisions.\n\nI\u2019m so lost.\n\nEdit\/Update: Thank you all so much for this information. A little more info on our full situation. My husband and I live in  Alaska in a more remote area and it was just the two of us. He died while running a 10k and I saw him about 3 minutes before and he was ecstatic and smiling and gave me a thumbs up. Both of our families live in New Mexico, so I will be moving back there. The boat was just a pleasure boat we'd use on the ocean and luckily it's a very sought after boat in this state so it should move quickly. We have one truck that is paid off and I will be selling that and keeping my Subaru. I went ahead and canceled all of the auto payments on his credit cards and I've already begun paperwork on IRA's and the life insurance policy. I'm fortunate that my family has means and are able to help me right now. My parents arrived the day after he died and his Dad and sister arrived Tuesday night, so I have a wonderful support network. I have about 13000 liquid with about 7000 more coming in so I'll be able to make the mortgage payment, car, etc. while we're waiting to clear things out. The ESOP is not paid out until a year after the event and my Dad has already contacted his financial advisor to help me navigate what to do with the money as well as not to be hit hard with taxes. I'll also be able to receive his Permanent Fund Dividend this year which is good since I guess it's supposed to be a whopper. I feel so fortunate that we somewhat had our shit together. My husband and I were both socking money away into our retirement accounts and we had a modest home so we could have lots of adventures, which we did. We lived without regrets and that is really helping me right now. Well I guess I slightly misspoke, I wish we did have more life insurance, but hindsights always 20\/20. If anyone can learn anything from my situation it is this: Life is fleeting. Live everyday to the fullest. My husband and I went on adventures nearly every weekend. Whether it be hiking, backpacking, bike-packing, boating, fishing, hunting, traveling, we were always doing something. We told each other numerous times a day that we loved each other and we were each others world. I will get through this and I will continue to accomplish the goals that we shared together. Life through me a shitty surprise, but it's not the end of the world. I will get better.

{"question":"Firstrade sold my position without my permission My story is not as bad as the questrade one, but this is a heads-up for anyone who uses Firstrade's level 3 margin account.\n\nI never go into margins due to my low risk appetite, and I generally own various stocks and sell cash secured put options. On May 1st, I received a notification saying that one of the 4 BA cash secured puts was bought to close with a loss. I was baffled since I did not recall making an order, and I have enough cash to buy the stocks so it couldn't have been the system forcing me to close. After waiting in line for 2 hours to get the customer service person on the phone (yep, that's the standard for Firstrade), I was informed that Firstrade's system sold my position but they are not sure why, they need to \"clear things up\" with the clearing firm, and that I should apply for level 4 margin account to prevent the same thing from happening again. After losing their client's money due to a mistake, Firstrade's response is essentially \"increase your risk appetite to prevent losing more money\".\n\nI asked for a follow-up and waited for two weeks with no news, so I eventually called and asked for the manager. After speaking to several clueless reps and being put on hold for several 30-minute chunks, I finally got to speak to the head of Firstrade's trading desk, who proceeded to repeat the same gibberish about how they are not sure what happened, they will take more time to investigate it if I want, and I should either downgrade the margin account to level 2 which does not allow verticals or upgrade it to level 4.

I know this is over probably 5 weeks, but I don\u2019t recall making any trades the first week I could trade options.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ehmd5em5goi61.jpg?width=401&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3083b37262e73c4cbe3d177ca36f5598cc84c24a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/an48wc5bgoi61.jpg?width=409&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f02612756a8bfd552f804143041f54d503dee27\n\n**\\*\\*Note** my profit number isn\u2019t accurate.

All the YouTube videos make it seem quicker to collect premium than it really is. I find that I\u2019m looking over my account way more than I probably should. I need to work on this.\n\n**Mistakes** I have had a few big mistakes that thankfully didn\u2019t bite me in the ass. Here are the ones that hopefully the new users don\u2019t make.\n\n**(1)** Not legging into a trade. Let\u2019s be honest, timing a trade perfectly is almost impossible. If you know you want to trade 10 contracts on an underlying. Nothing worse than going all in and next day you are -20%.\n\n**(2)** Chasing a tanking stock. UWMC crew represent. I kept adding CSP\u2019s to this piece of shit stock and it continued to tank. I could have used those funds on other stocks that could have actually made me money. At the peak, I had 45 contracts, accounting for almost 50% of my account. UWMC went up intraday a week or so ago and I was able to get out of the trade flat. From now on, I can sleep well at night knowing 1 or 2 contracts are -75%.\n\n**Help from the group**\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**(1)** I am really struggling with letting time work its thing with CSPs. I seem to get to 20% profits decently quickly on my trades, sometimes with 35-30 days left to expire and close. I get antsy and move on to something else. My trades are going well, and I fear jumping into something else and it turn into a bad trade and turn the prior winning trade into a wash. How do I break this habit?\n\nIn addition, I think I fuel this habit by frequently  open all my trades at once (with exact DTE), and close all at once. I need to turn it opening a few at different times, which will result in closing at different times as the options get to 20 DTE.\n\n**(2)** Since starting thetagang, I\u2019m tending to hawk over my account constantly. How do you guys make this more passive? I don\u2019t want this to distract me from my main income (job).","answer":"IMO there's some symptoms of destructive thinking going on here.\n\nObviously, I don't know you, so I'm just reacting to what's in your message.\n\nHere are the red flags I see:\n\n1. \" Nothing worse than going all in and next day you are -20%. \"\n2. \"  Chasing a tanking stock. \"\n3. \"  I get antsy and move on to something else.  \"\n\nBasically #1 is hindsight talking. What if you had been legging in and your position went up 20% on day 2? You'd be griping about the missed opportunity. IMO if you're feeling this kind of regret, it's not the timeframe that was at fault - you just made too big a bet.\n\nThe combination of #2 and #3 is a classic gambling problem - you don't press your wins and you chase your losses. Basically, this is a sign of being in it for the high of the win, not for the overall returns. This type of pattern can lead to large losses over time.\n\nYour lack of patience is possibly a sign of the same pattern. You're too focused on the individual trades, and not focused (or patient) enough on the overall result.\n\nI think there's a lot of good advice in this thread on specific things to look at in terms of your trades, but my two cents' worth is you should also make sure your head is right."}

Given our insane spending and relatively low tax rates some increases might cut into the deficit. \n\n&gt; Additionally, those policies lower the federal debt via two mechanisms: First, lower drug prices for Medicare directly translate to a decrease in government deficits.

{"question":"Gamestop's $400 Billion NFTransformation Part II **TA;CR: The digital banana stand will bring tendies back to Gamestop**\n\nPart I of Gamestop\u2019s $400 Billion NFTransformation covered Gamestop\u2019s past and the unexpected turnaround. This part will cover its trajectory to profitability using the marketplace and the strategic partnerships with Immutable and Loopring.\n\n[Link to Part I](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/x0ptbv\/gamestops_400_billion_nftransformation\/)\n\n**Part IV: The Transformation in Action**\n\nBear Thesis: Gamestop is hated by customers, developers, and employees alike. Everyone wants to see this ship burn and sink.\n\nBull Thesis: Gamestop is buoyed by the January 2021 sneeze and seen as a revived, customer centric brand.\n\nThe Gamestop NFT marketplace seeks to build value between developers and customers. Instead of the old predatory arbitrage model that favored Gamestop, the new marketplace fees provide liquidity to customers, a more fluid audience to game developers, and a share of recurring income from the resale of in-game digital assets. To see the benefits of the marketplace and wallet, consider the value proposition to the following parties covered in the bear thesis:\n\nCustomers: Currently purchase a digital game with no resale value, or a free-to-play game with microtransactions anchored to the game and no liquidity. With digital ingame assets tied to NFTs, web3 games are now play-to-earn and provide multi-platform liquidity for players via Gamestop\u2019s marketplace. Gamers can now sell or rent their digital assets in one game via the marketplace to invest in a new game. The trade-in value for their digital goods is actually fair and far exceeds Gamestop\u2019s old trade in values for physical games in the past. The e-commerce experience on the website now includes same-day delivery and price matching, with an ever-expanding inventory of collectibles. New customer experience centers are also being tested and deployed in high traffic locations. For the gaming enthusiast, the value and customer experience is better at Gamestop than anywhere else.\n\nDevelopers: The partnership with IMX includes a grant fund and one of the deliverables is quality web3 content. I believe that smaller developers have the most to benefit from player churn and residual income from an active marketplace. Understanding the developer incentive is crucial since no one will switch to a platform where they lose money. So, why should developers even think about approaching Immutable \/ Gamestop NFT?\n\nWith the illiquid app store environment, mobile game developers need to focus on player retention and avoid player churn (inactive accounts, uninstalls, etc.). Constant engagement is needed to keep the paying crowd retained, using sunk cost fallacy, high level bonuses, subscription models, and other game mechanics to keep players playing. Under this current model, **when a player churns, revenue to the developer immediately becomes zero.** Furthermore, the value of any ingame assets, whether the player is active or not, is effectively zero. The player carries zero assets going to the next game, and needs to provide additional liquidity, paying for ingame purchases via app store wallet. Remember, most of the gaming demographic has limited liquidity. Let\u2019s look at this in action:\n\nPlayer A spends $50 on Developer A\u2019s game.\n\nPlayer A churns, Developer A gets $0.\n\nPlayer A picks up a game from Developer B, spends $30 of remaining liquidity on Developer B\u2019s game.\n\nLittle Johnny, our recurring liquidity problem, has limited options with the current mobile cash shop model. Under the web3 model, something interesting happens:\n\nPlayer A spends $50 on Developer A\u2019s game.\n\nPlayer A churns, gets $30 trade in value for his ingame loot, Developer A gets $3.\n\nPlayer A picks up a game from Developer B, spends $60 of remaining liquidity ($30 Player A has left over plus $30 from trade ins) on Developer B\u2019s game.\n\nWith web3, the developer makes money from player churn. The player who bought Player A\u2019s loot is a new customer, which was **acquired at a cost of negative three dollars**. With the first scenario, two developers fighting over the same customer will either receive $50 or $30. In the second scenario, they get either $53 or $60.\n\nThe developer also makes money when a whale (a player that spends a ton of money on the game) sells their duplicate items on the secondary market. Not only is there an inherent benefit to the biggest spenders, the developer profits when the game items are sold for a perpetual royalty. In the event that the game becomes massively popular, the laws of supply and demand increase the value of existing ingame items like special collaboration gear. This could effectively reverse player churn, as long time players who have gone inactive log in once more to find out their rare loot has appreciated in value \u2013 think Magic: The Gathering players who stopped playing in Beta and picked up the game again. A subclass of players may also speculatively invest in the game for this reason. All three of these player actions are monetization only possible with web3. If you have been paying attention to the AMAs with Immutable and the posts they have been making about recruiting developers and going to GDC, you can deduce the formation of a Play to Earn multiverse of games and collectibles. Take a look at Immutable's feed for yourself. It will take time for these developers to launch on Gamestop, depending on how far along their existing projects are before they decided to implement web3.\n\nEmployees: No sugar coating here, the working conditions in many stores are poor. There is little upward mobility, and a huge disconnect between executive management and the actual workers. It\u2019s not a happy place, and one of the reasons why we see RC tweeting photos on location at stores. When Gamestop fired hundreds of employees at head office, this likely included old guard district managers that were resistant to change and enabled the corporate culture to fester at the expense of front line retail workers. Cutting administrative head count is typically a positive indicator for most companies with negative earnings \u2013 Peloton\u2019s stock took off like a rocket when they announced a huge reduction in head count, but believe it or not, in Gamestop\u2019s case, **dip**. I see this and the approval of 8,000,000 shares towards the employee stock compensation plan as positive. It allows upward mobility for exceptionally performing store managers and stock compensation rewards for employees \u2013 accountability comes with ownership. Like any decent human being, I want to see conditions for the front line employees improve, but it must be done in a way that is sustainable and beneficial for the long term operation of the company. While I am bullish about the new talent on board, I am only cautiously optimistic about those at the bottom of the ladder. There\u2019s likely going to be more short term pain before long term gains as leases terminate on unprofitable stores. Gamestop needs to on board millions of players to the wallet and marketplace enabled games and grow them enough to get in some positive cash flow on the balance sheet before they can hand out cash raises to thousands of employees. The only benefit Gamestop employees really got was some relief the paycheck would not bounce and a few nice customers. Oh, and some toxic district managers who got fired. Bullish on the store manager who fills the empty shoes.\n\n**Part V: The Bull Thesis Looking Forward**\n\nThis part is speculation and yet to materialize. The NFT market and mobile gaming both have double digit CAGRs for the next 5 years. This is where Gamestop is positioning the platform. It has great tailwinds from the market trends behind it, and only needs to leverage an existing customer base to make things spicy. To succeed as Gamestop Digital, I expect the following catalysts to improve the company\u2019s forward facing revenue:\n\n**Increased developer uptake in web3 gaming:** Gamestop\u2019s partnership with Immutable is key to jumpstarting this innovation, but it needs good games and in volume to really stir up marketplace activity and fees. In its heyday, Gamestop made billions of dollars per year in arbitrage. The current marketplace and number of web3 play to earn (P2E) games is still in its infancy and a long way from raking in billions in marketplace fees a year. The good news is, mobile games can rack up millions of dollars of revenue in a matter of months due to the sheer number of people who have smartphones \u2013 Diablo Immortal hit $180 million in two months, and Genshin Impact took 5.2 months to hit $1 billion. Developers should see Gamestop NFT as a place where they can make games that bring in continuous revenue, compared to a digital storefront platform that brings in diminishing returns each time the game goes on sale with no chance of residual income. Gamestop leveraging its platform to form strategic partnerships and promotions with developers, like it did during its prime years, would be incredibly bullish for the company. There\u2019s a good setup right now for developers, with IMX providing the software tools to implement web3, Gamestop offering the marketplace, and Loopring offering the financial plumbing that goes on behind the user wallet to facilitate low transaction fees on layer 2. All the developer needs to enable web3 is integrating the Immutable SDK. Nothing else needs to be built from scratch.\n\nA common objection to Gamestop\u2019s marketplace is there are no AAA developers have signed on board, but with mobile, AAA studio branding is not a requirement for success. Since when was Elex, Mihoyo, Plarium, Rovio, and Mixi considered AAA? Yet, they have well over $10 billion in revenue between all of them. Gamestop can\u2019t be like Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo and swallow up big development studios, it simply does not have the capitalization. Which brings us to the next catalyst to watch for:\n\n**Partnerships with dormant gaming intellectual properties (IPs):** Gamestop cannot afford to buy Mario and Friends, but it can bring back the classics in one form or another like with the recent Betty Boop digital collectible. When Disney could no longer milk the Power Rangers cash cow, they sold it back to Saban, who then went in for a second harvest by selling high quality collectibles to the kids in the fandom who are now adults with disposable income. The legacy Megazord was priced at a premium and sold like hot cakes (hey Gamestop, sell these again at MSRP and I will buy at least two). Robosen has a self transforming G1 Optimus Prime that sells for $999 USD. The lesson here? There\u2019s tons of money to be made in dormant IPs with nostalgia value. Zlongame revived the Langrisser franchise on mobile and made billions from a huge fandom that played pirated copies of Langrisser II as kids and then grew up to have disposable income. The same company is reviving the Front Mission series for mobile. Gamestop is now a brand known for coming back from the dead. Bringing back IPs like Heavy Gear or Syndicate would cash in on the adults with nostalgia and disposable income demographic very well. Both founders had Kickstarter projects that were under $600,000 and met their funding goals.\n\nThe ace that Gamestop holds here is what the entertainment industry calls the nostalgia pendulum, or the nostalgia sandwich, a period of time which is 15 to 40 years, from when content consumers become content makers and adults with income. Even big companies like Netflix, which also face the problem of more and more IPs being stonewalled by producers under their own streaming services, respond by reviving dormant franchises that already have a built in fan base. This is why Stranger Things, Ghostbusters, Robocop, and most recently, Top Gun: Maverick, have such broad appeal to the tune of billions of dollars. If we look at the gaming time horizon, this would incorporate the period from 1982 to 2007, a golden era of gaming. There are hundreds of dormant IPs that fall within this nostalgia sandwich and not affiliated with the big three console companies or AAA studios. If Gamestop follows the Hollywood formula, once again, the conservative, sandwich-heavy portfolio will pay off for the hungry investor.\n\nCompanies like Konami and SNK licensing out franchises for web3 games would also be a positive development. Gacha based mobile games are already like fancy slot machines, which both companies also license. Providing the license to an experienced smaller studio to create a mobile web3 game and doing so in volume is actually within reach of Gamestop\u2019s capitalization.\n\nThe next logical step once Gamestop \/ IMX produces a hit franchise revival is merchandising, and this is where it can tap existing suppliers on the shoulder that they already have a good business relationship with and push out merchandise with juicy, double digit margins (T-shirt sales are the sweetest peach). Digital releases that do well could follow with Collector\u2019s Edition preorders that have a physical game and other swag. The dormant IP route leveraging their existing distribution network and customer base would be an appropriate response given the segmentation and profits that we see in the streaming market.\n\n**Changing customer attitudes towards blockchain:** Hedgie-owned gaming blogs continue to bash blockchain tech and foment negative sentiment. A few great games that demonstrate the value of being able to transfer or rent your time investment between games are needed to change the overall view of the technology. What\u2019s the difference between your farm in Farmville and POGs? People on eBay still get money for their POGs because they hold value as a collectible. The future will include games where you can rent out your exotic weapons on the marketplace and have someone else hire your character as a mercenary and get tokens in return. I disagree with the view that play to earn turns gaming into a second job. Instead, it lets people with limited funds get more out of their hobby by promoting a circular economy. The current cash shops in mobile games restrict player funds. Making them web3 assets gives players back their liquidity, like when they traded in cartridges back in the 1990s. Web3 is Power to the Players. The move to non-custodial wallets instead of a centralized database would prevent a catastrophic breach of assets. Equifax shit the bed and the CEO went to jail for only four months for insider trading and spent zero months in jail for giving Al-Qaeda your FICO score \u2013 gamers would destroy a brand if all their loot went missing under their supervision.\n\n**Increased Gamestop Wallet Integration:** It\u2019s only a matter of time until we see NFTs accompanying physical purchases of collectibles. We already have NFTs of lambos that come with the car. The future may bring animated Funko Pop NFTs that accompany the physical product. We may see Gamestop and developer sponsored tournament winner NFT badges turning up in the marketplace. That being said, given all the negative connotation with the word NFT, I can see the future referring to the technology as digital assets and digital collectibles instead. You know, like how that show Pocket Monster in Japan had an episode that gave kids epilepsy, so they changed it to Pok\u00e9mon overseas to fool parents. Seeing collectors adapt Gamestop Wallet as the place to store and display their non-meatspace collectibles would bring great long term value to both customers and vendors. In addition to reviving dormant IPs, Gamestop could also issue collectibles both in store and in wallet to tie in with the launch. Remember all those promo items from midnight launches? Digital collectibles are another way developers can gift swag to their supporters.\n\nTo increase adoption of the Gamestop Wallet, a promotional option to use the $5 Powerup rewards credit to initially fund the wallet would go a long way towards speeding up user count. As mentioned by RC in the activist letter, the PowerUp Rewards program has millions of members. Using the monthly credit to create a new wallet will give millions of junior gamers with no access to a credit card a way to earn and access cash shop items in mobile games \u2013 and nothing spreads faster than rumors on a playground. If Gamestop was the pioneer who broke down the paywall for kids without mom\u2019s credit card, they would instantly have another generation of loyal customers.\n\nWith that said, the final part of the bull thesis are readers like you. Gamestop\u2019s profitability is dependent on retail consumers like you, and if that means price matching items so you can buy them at Gamestop or helping others to onboard the Gamestop Wallet, it will go a long way to ensuring a future where your stock investment pays regular dividends. The market is already planning an ETF that is only short Gamestop. DRS will murder these bagholders, but only your continuous support will ensure Gamestop lives on to see some or all of these catalysts come to fruition.

I guess what happens is that the low price area isn't well compensated, as the link says, but they are exporting goods of a low price area to a high price area, wouldn't that probably make the price higher?","answer":"&gt;  Over the whole period, drain from the South totalled $62 trillion (constant 2011 dollars), or $152 trillion when accounting for lost growth\n\nThe thing about this is that this perspective will see something like mining a natural resource and selling it for cheaper than the value the buyer could extract from it as \"drain.\" The fact is that the selling entity is still compensated, and in most cases didn't actually have the ability to extract further value from the resource in the first place.\n\nThis doesn't just affect poor countries. Different countries specialize in different \"value adds,\" and it's not at all uncommon for certain countries to simply specialize in the lowest level value add: resource extraction. For example, Australia is quite a developed country, but they specialize very heavily in the extraction of natural resources. According to this mode of thinking, when China buys from Australia and turns their iron into steel, which they turn into buildings, or into electronic components, etc, China is \"draining\" from Australia. Or when the US buys electronic components from China and uses them to run services, they are extracting even further service from those resources...and \"draining\" China?\n\nEverybody has been compensated along the way, just because there is further value down the pipeline that can be extracted from a resource doesn't mean that the entity at the beginning of the chain gets to claim that they've been denied all of the value added by entities down the chain. It isn't implicit that Australia would have the manufacturing capabilities of China if not for exploitation, or that services rendered by the Chinese would suit the needs of Americans if not for the American development of the services themselves."}

I have just made a 6 month emergency fund, paid off my outstanding debts, raised my credit score in to the mid 700s, and have reduced my living expenses to roughly 25% of my take home(including entertainment etc).\n\nCurrently, I'm on track to max my 401k and my IRA while still having roughly 20k left over(potentially 35-40 next year because my emergency account is already funded). Where should I be putting this additional money to help myself catch up?","answer":"In whatever investment vehicle you want. For stocks you can open a brokerage account. For real estate you would save for your downpayment and reno costs. You could invest in collectibles or bullion or art or some other assets that vary in liquidity. You could look into bonds or CDs (I haven\u2019t checked rates lately but im guessing still not great). There\u2019s also doubling the emergency fund, renovating your own house, buying time for money (delivery,cleaner,etc). Really depends on your goals where you go next"}

But I was weak, and my stock purchases trickled back over this year, and its cost me around 30%. And now, when I would rather buy property, rates suck.","answer":"It's crazy when I hold cash I spend it on dumb shit and go out to eat more, and I don't realize it was a 100% loss and I don't blink an eye.

{"question":"Benjamin Graham - signs of a bubble Benjamin Graham writes 5 signs of historical bubbles in his book, The Intelligent Investor:\n\n1. Historically high price level\n\n2. High p\/e\n\n3.

{"question":"In Ireland, confused about my investing options and pensions I have been reading The Simple Path to Wealth and I am completely sold on the idea of regular investing in Vanguard funds. However it seems they are not available in Ireland and that the tax rate here makes it not worthwhile. \n\nI am really confused about my options for investing. I already have a personal pension plan I pay into and one with my job where they match my contributions. However I have the goal of retiring early and I understand that you cannot use your pension until you are 60. \n\nI am looking for a fund like VTSAX that I can invest in. What are some good options for someone living in Ireland? Should I forget the idea and just go all in on my pension plans?","answer":"Your pension is definitely the most tax effective place to start investing. If you\u2019re in the higher tax bracket you could be doubling your money the minute you put it in your pension.\n\nReally important to make sure your pension is invested purely into the stockmarket though. Many will have you in excessively low risk investments like bonds, property, cash etc.\n\nIn order of priority the suggested approach here is -\n\n- save for house deposit\n\n- pay mortgage down to comfortable level, because interest rates are higher than likely investment returns\n\n- max your pension contributions\n\n- build an emergency fund (say \u20ac10-20k) in cash or Government saving bonds which can be accessed quickly\n\n- any money left you should invest in the stock market or start your own business or whatever your plan is. ETFs are a good way to get broad exposure and the deemed disposal tax rules are grossly exaggerated."}
{"question":"What was the biggest mistake you made trading stocks or options ? Eleven years ago, I was so green trading options.  I made every mistake in the book.

{"question":"Goldman cuts U.S. GDP forecast as it says recession odds are as high as 35% The U.S. stock market put in a resilient performance on Thursday, given the data showing inflation surging to a new 40-year high even before the impact of the recent sanctions on Russia, what appeared to be a pretty dismal result from the Russian-Ukrainian meeting of foreign ministers in Turkey, and a surprisingly hawkish decision by the European Central Bank.\n\nBesides the humanitarian catastrophe, sky-high commodities prices have been the result so far of what has been a two-week invasion. Economists at Goldman Sachs have now cut their forecast for growth for the world\u2019s largest economy in 2022 to 1.75%, from 2% previously and the consensus of 2.75%.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty straightforward call. \u201cCombining our commodity strategists\u2019 forecasts with estimates of pass-through to consumer prices, we estimate that rising gas and food prices will create an effective 0.7 percent point drag on real disposable personal income in 2022 with larger drags for lower-income households whose spending is typically more sensitive to fluctuations in income,\u201d said the note written by Joseph Briggs. \u201cAlthough households will likely partially offset this income drag by reducing savings, this hit to income should weigh on spending in 2022.\u201d\n\nBesides commodity prices, the Goldman team also noted that consumer sentiment tends to be affected by geopolitical crises, and already gauges from Morning Consult and Ipsos have dropped. The downgrade to Europe\u2019s growth prospects will hit U.S. exports, and a tightening of financial conditions will also weigh on U.S. growth.\n\nThe Goldman team said, if anything, they may be too positive on the outlook for the U.S. economy. \u201cEven after these downgrades, we still see risks around our growth forecast as skewed to the downside, particularly if sanctions escalate or if oil prices rise even further, for example, to the $175\/barrel price target our commodity strategists see as possible if supply losses reach four million barrels a day. Additionally, we have not assumed any growth hit due to metal shortages since\u2014aside from palladium\u2014only a small share of U.S. commodity demand is met by Russian exports,\u201d said Briggs.\n\nRecession risks, they said, are mounting. While they expect further service-sector reopening and spending from excess savings to keep the U.S. economy growing, they said the chances of a recession next year are between 20% and 35%, or roughly as implied by the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve.\n\n[https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/goldman-cuts-u-s-gdp-forecast-to-a-full-point-below-consensus-as-it-says-recession-odds-are-as-high-as-35-11646999690?mod=home-page](https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/goldman-cuts-u-s-gdp-forecast-to-a-full-point-below-consensus-as-it-says-recession-odds-are-as-high-as-35-11646999690?mod=home-page)","answer":"Had the Fed pulled back accommodation a bit earlier in better times, there would be some room to ease policy when the economy is facing slowing growth. \n\nThey helped save the economy at the outset of Covid, but they didn't \"take profits\"--and now we're here.

Monthly budgets have a huge shortfall when it comes to accounting for future expenses. \n\nSome people call it a wish farm rather than sinking funds but the concept is pretty similar. \n\nFor me it's anticipated expenses like car insurance, vacations, a new winter coat and how I'm going to pay them.\n\nFor the examples below assume a January budget start. \n\nExamples  \nGoal: have enough cash on hand to pay car insurance   \nCost: $1000 every six months  \nTimeline: 6 months, June 2020  \nIf you start in January that means you need to save $166\/month so that when your insurance is due in June you have the money no sweat.   \n\nGoal: new winter coat  \nCost: $175  \nTimeline: 10 months\/by next winter, say October 2020  \nSinking fund: $17.50\/month for 10 months  \nThat's $17.50 a month to save between now and then. If I see a coat on sale in the meantime my budget adjusts accordingly. May? I've saved $87.50.  July? I've saved  $122.50 for that coat.    \n\nIt's saving money you intend to spend so there's less guilt when you do spend it.   \n\nGoal: new running shoes  \nCost: $85  \nTimeline: 9 months,  Sept 2020  \n\nSinking fund: $9.50\/month for 9 months  \n\nGoal: travel home for the holidays Dec 2020  \nCost: $400  \nTimeline: buy by Oct 2020, 10 months  \nIf you set this goal in January you'll have basically 10 months to save $400.    \nSinking fund = $40\/month for 10 months\n\nGoal: cash on hand in two years for new tires  \nCost: $1000      \nTimeline: Dec 2021    \nSinking fund: $41\/month for 24 months      \n\nYou'll have a slew of these going at a time.

{"question":"The March To Zero Liquidity: Volume or Bust (Reprised) **TL;DR:** Ken and Co. are Captain Hook and the ticking is getting louder and louder. The debt established to escape their demise in January continues to show it's presence when volume gets too low. It seems challenging for the shorts to significantly withdraw buying pressure from the market (thereby reducing volume) while continuing to fight the laws of supply and demand. We are currently at the lowest volume ever compared to January highs that caused the first sneeze. Historically, they can only withdraw volume for so long before they need to add it back. And, when that happens... wooosaaaaa.\n\n[Ken.... Melvin?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/n7turnx5zva71.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fafa6bd03432c845140ca2699734d46011eb447)\n\n# 0. Introduction and Rewind\n\nTwo months ago I wrote about [The March to Zero Liquidity: Volume or Bust](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/n3ehw0\/the_march_to_zero_liquidity_volume_or_bust\/).\n\nWhile you\u2019re welcome to read up on the backstory, I\u2019ll give you the sparknotes:\n\n* Low liquidity in the market on a security makes it thinly traded\n* Thinly traded securities are susceptible to slippage, which is when the bid-ask spread widens and green or red crayon markings have lots of space between them. One share goes for $200 and the next for $203\n* That space creates a highly volatile environment, which is prime for a security to have substantial moves up or down.\n* We\u2019ve been here before \u2013 two times in the last six months \n\nFor those in the back of the classroom, here are some **quick definitions:**\n\n* Bid-Ask Spread: the space between the lowest seller and highest buyer, which facilitates the market.\n* Liquidity: the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought (bid) or sold (ask) in the market at a price reflecting its intrinsic value (spread). If there is a big gap between the bid and ask, $95-$105, it\u2019s hard for a trade at or near the mean of $100 to happen.\n* Volatility: how bigly a security can move around its mean value.\n* Thinly Traded: a security that cannot be traded without significant change in price.\n* Slippage: the difference between the expected price of a trade and the point at which the trade is executed. This can occur when a large order is executed and there is not enough volume to maintain the current price range within the big-ask spread.\n\n# 1. Purpose and Old Wounds Festering\n\nThe purpose of this data|education post is to refresh some old DD I posted with new data to test it against upcoming price movement to see if we have a pattern. **The essential argument is that while GME was massively shorted prior to January, they took actions that substantially worsened the problem by massively shorting GME more in January and they must fix.**\n\nTo illustrate, I\u2019ll risk stupidly quoting myself from two months ago for your ease of reading only one post rather than referencing two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In life, and certainly when it comes to the tale of naked shorting $GME, **sometimes one problem creates another.** That\u2019s exactly what Citadel is experiencing **with** their well-documented **movement of buy orders to dark pools.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;During this brief Ted Talk, I\u2019ll venture to prove that **Citadel\u2019s strategy of selling in the open market while buying in dark pools is marching GME toward Zero Liquidity**. Tick tock. Tick tock. The motive behind removing buying from the open market is to limit buying pressure and balance with selling to stabilize the price. O**ver time, this action has reduced liquidity with a trajectory of it being near zero.**\n\nWow\u2026 for two months we\u2019ve been talking routinely about egregious dark pool activity in our \u201cfree\u201d market. And, for at least two months we\u2019ve been debating T+X cycles, FINRA\/SEC legalese, calendar vs settlement vs Juneteenth days, and TA. **Vomit**. \n\nMy intention is not to settle how or when they must settle up. It\u2019s simply to affirm our agreement that they are still massively short due to limited liquidity and demonstrate that their window is closing on their mission to avoid the laws of supply and demand which would require the price to increase based on our circumstances.\n\n# 2. Time is running out. Tick tock... tick tock...\n\nSurely Ken and Co. knows how close to the sun they are flying.  \n\n\n&gt;**Ever since mid-January, volume moved on a decreasing slope.** I downloaded historical quotes ( [https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/market-activity\/stocks\/gme\/historical](https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/market-activity\/stocks\/gme\/historical)) to begin my research here. Sure, we\u2019ve had spikes that likely are instances resulting from the well-documented FTD Cycle. However, **when charting a 5-day trailing average of volume by percentage of the mid-January squeeze, the number of shares traded** according to NASDAQ historical volume **is declining significantly.**\n\nSo, I've updated the chart for your pent up viewing pleasure:\n\n \n\n[Volume as a percentage of Jan 13th volume. Pretty much at zero, yes?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wl66h4d6xva71.png?width=983&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c9ccc9eaf45075e8063004d26823745871143af)\n\nAnd.... **here's the data to go along for you beautiful Apes that have trust issues:**\n\n[Numbers + a #DIV\\\/0!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5j7f9sn1xva71.png?width=661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d5bbe527944a46a5d1a71d1afb552813e8fd60c)\n\n# 3. Onward to Neverland.\n\n1)\t**GME is trading below 2% of the January volume highs.** Even if we assumed they shorted less shares than the Ape who did a trick with his banana since that day, there\u2019s not nearly enough volume to close their positions. \n\n2)\t**GME is most certainly a thinly traded stock**. While January was absurdly high volume comparative the float, GME is still trading well below a reasonable number of shares in the open market. More fuckery continues than the last time we checked in on volume two months ago making the stock we like highly susceptible to slippage.\n\n3)\t**The 5-day trailing average volume compared to Jan 13 has never been as low as it is today.** Essentially, they are flying incredibly close to the sun for an extended period of time. The last times it\u2019s held a low percentage consecutively was likely May 5-11, which resulted in two 12%+ share price days within a week.\n\nGiven this is Data| Education, I wont say much more to limit speculation. Just know that GME is standing on a saber's edge. Let's just let the tock tick. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dlasok5ezva71.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d64d6b532b2980221cf3dc8e82495b1847e0663","answer":"Man, after a long weekend of shitty DD filled with \u201comgz I figured out the algo!\u201d And \u201ccriptoes dividendz everybody!\u201d And a healthy dose of \u201cftd cycles\u201d all pointing to the 14th, it feels good to have a little bit of actual DD."}

I just wanted to make this post to help out those among you that've seen your portfolios drop in the last few weeks to feel better about yourselves. I started investing heavily in early 2015 and while I'm still in the black, over the past two weeks I've encroached $10,000 in losses from those unrealized gains.

{"question":"1% Rule Meaning I have just started becoming interested in investing into real estate and have been looking at different markets that support the 1% rule for single family homes.

For example a $60000 home is renting for $900 in Memphis. Vs a $1,000,000 home in SF, an area with tons of jobs, rents for $5,000.\n\nSo my questions are: \nwhat does the 1% rule really mean about the area where this rent to value ratio is possible? \n\nWhy does it exist that the mortgage is significantly less than the rent? \n\nWhat does this mean about the potential growth in the area and the future value of the home? \n\nI understand I am looking for cash flow, but what if in 30 years people don\u2019t even want to live in that area so the property and home value is now $0.\n\nThanks in advanced!

{"question":"r\/FatFIRE Frequently Asked Questions *Please see below for some of the commonly asked questions about FatFIRE in general, and the* r\/FatFIRE *sub specifically. This FAQ will be updated on an ongoing basis.*\n\n**What is FatFIRE?**\n\nFatFIRE is Financial Independence \/ Retire Early at an overabundant or luxurious level. Unlike FIRE (and leanFIRE in particular), FatFIRE is typically achieved through high incomes rather than minimalism or extreme frugality.\n\n**What are the minimum levels of income or net worth required to be considered FatFIRE?**\n\nWe do not have a set minimum to be considered FatFIRE. Individual circumstances vary so greatly that it would be impossible to set a single level \u2013 a family with high fixed expenses in a high-cost-of-living-area might require double or triple the income or assets of an individual living in a low-cost-of-living-area to enjoy a similar quality of life.\n\n**I see that there are members with flair marked \u2018Verified by Mods\u2019. What are the requirements for verification, and how do I get verified?**\u00a0\n\nMembers can be verified as being on the \u2018path to FatFIRE\u2019 at an annual income of US$150,000+ per year, or net worth greater than US$1 million. Some adjustments are made for those living in low cost-of-living countries on a case-by-case basis.\n\nTo verify, please submit your proof of income or net worth via modmail, along with your requested flair. If you are requesting a certain income or net worth be included in your flair, then you should be including proof of those specific claims.\n\nTo verify, take your smartphone and make one continuous video recording of the following:\n\n1. Go to the login page for your verification proof on your desktop\/mobile browser (you do not need to show us the login credentials). The verification proof we accept are official statements like pay stubs, bank statements, brokerage statements, etc. We do not accept websites\/apps that combine external assets from different places into one place (e.g. Mint).\n2. Now log into the website while keeping your camera recording the URL of the browser the entire time. Do not move the camera away from the address bar of your browser this entire time. We want to see the URL change from the login page to the page you end up with after you login.\n3. And without ever moving the video away from the URL, browse to the verification screen that has the numbers that you want to show us (if you're not already there). You're welcome to frame\/crop the video to block out any personal info\/account numbers or put something over the personal info to cover it, but do not block the URL from being seen. We only care about the number you want to verify with while making sure the URL of the website matches the location of this verification proof the entire time.\n4. Once you have the number and URL in the same video frame, refresh the browser once to show us that the numbers don't change to something totally different when you refresh.\n\nYou can upload the video to imgur as a private video link (or any other video service) and send us the video via modmail to complete your verification.\n\nWe do not need proof of your entire net worth or income, just enough to meet the threshold. However, if you wish to have a number in your flair (eg. NW $15M, Income $350K+) then we need to see proof of those amounts.\n\nWe are also willing to consider other verification options if you'd prefer - anything that would objectively demonstrate your wealth. Mods are volunteers, so please allow a day or two for us to verify. If several days have gone past without a reply, please feel free to follow up with us.\n\nDo not set your own flair as 'Verified by Mods' if you have not been verified, as that may result in a temporary or permanent ban from this sub. Verified members should not modify their own flair once verified - instead, please write to us via Modmail to request a change to your flair.\n\n**How do I know if someone is really verified?**\n\nVerified members' flair appears in special colors which are visible in [old.reddit.com](https:\/\/old.reddit.com). \n\n**Is there a chart that explains what the different colors mean?**\n\nNo - it's only for mod use. But feel free to speculate.\n\n**What are the benefits of verifying?**\n\nGenerally, verified members\u2019 opinions are given a greater weight than those who have not been verified \u2013 at least for new members to r\/FatFIRE. Verified members are also able to take part in \u2018Verified Members Only\u2019 posts.\n\n**Will verification ever become required?**\n\nThere are currently no plans to make verification mandatory. Many of our regular contributors are not comfortable with the verification process. Also, FatFIRE mods are not able to commit the potential time and effort required to verify tens of thousands of members.\n\n**What do you mean by \u201cspecifically relevant\u201d to FatFIRE?**\n\nA post may be removed under rule 1 when it\u2019s not specifically relevant to FatFIRE. This means that it must be relevant to FatFIRE alone, and not more relevant to leanFIRE, FIRE, Financial Independence, investing, etc.. High dollar values are not sufficient justification for relevance, unless they fundamentally change the nature of the question.\n\nFor example, \u201cwhere should I invest $5 million?\u201d is generally not considered specifically relevant, as the question of how to invest is largely the same for $50,000 in investments as opposed to $5 million. \u201cIs $20 million enough to justify support from a multi-family office?\u201d is relevant, as multi-family offices are generally the purview of wealthy families.\n\n**What do you mean by \u201cno ask-a-rich-person\u201d questions?**\n\nWe define \u201cask-a-rich-person\u201d questions as those questions where the only specific relevance is found in wanting to get FatFIRE\u2019s take on a specific issue, and questions that are posed with limited personal context. For example - \u201cWhat are your favourite books?\u201d, \u201cHow long is your mortgage term?\u201d, or \u201cWhat is your advice to a new millionaire?\u201d\n\n**My post was removed, and I don\u2019t believe it violated any rules. Can I appeal this decision?**\n\nIf you feel your post was removed despite not violating the rules, then you can contact the mod team via modmail to request that another mod review your post. Generally, any post with negative karma will not be reinstated.\n\nBear in mind that if your post contained insulting, discourteous, or judgmental content then the subsequent review might end up with you receiving a temporary or permanent ban, rather than a reinstatement.\n\n**Someone posted a judgmental comment, and I reported it. Why wasn\u2019t it removed?**\n\nThe \u201cno judgement\u201d rule applies specifically to comments and posts that judge others based on income or asset level, or living a luxurious lifestyle. Comments that are otherwise critical of members \u2013 say, the efficacy of their investment strategies \u2013 will not be removed, provided that those comments are neither insulting nor discourteous.\n\n**Someone replied to my post with \"Go fuck yourself\" or \"Make me some breakfast.\" I reported this comment for being discourteous, but it wasn't removed. Why?**\n\nIf you have recently FatFIREd or experienced a sudden windfall, then being told to \"go fuck yourself\" is considered a [term of celebration](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/8pwsy8\/how_did_the_go_fuck_yourself_tradition_in_this\/) in which the commenter is expressing a kind of envious admiration for your situation. [\"Make me some breakfast\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/fatFIRE\/comments\/knslkb\/i_just_confirmed_that_for_the_first_time_ever_i\/) is similar, but specific to r\/FatFIRE.\n\nIn instances where OP has not FatFIREd, such comments may be considered discourteous and dealt with accordingly. But otherwise these comments will be left up.\n\n**Is there an index of relevant FatFIRE posts from over the years?**\n\nYes - please check out [The fatFIRE Index](https:\/\/fatfireindex.com\/). Thanks go to u\/flowingserenity for putting this together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Acronym list:**\n\nETF - Exchange Traded Fund. Typically refers to an investment fund that tracks a specific stock market index, such as the S&amp;P 500.\n\nFIRE - Financial Independence, Retire Early.\n\nFAANG - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google. Sometimes used to refer to other large tech firms in general.\n\nHENRY - High Earner, Not Rich Yet\n\nGFYS - \"Go fuck yourself.\" A term of congratulations when OP has FatFIREd.\n\nNW - Net worth\n\nSWR - Safe withdrawal rate. Generally considered to be 4% or less, though this is a subject of some debate throughout the FIRE community.\n\n(V)HCOL, MCOL, LCOL - (Very) High Cost of Living, Medium Cost of Living, Low Cost of Living\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*If you have suggestions for further questions (and \/ or answers), please leave a comment on this post or send us a message via Modmail.*\n\n*We would also appreciate if members could include links to previous FatFIRE posts that they believe provide definitive answers to frequently posted questions such as how to establish a family office, when to fly first class, benefits of establishing a donor advised fund, etc.*","answer":"Recently discovered this sub.

{"question":"EPF part of your debt allocation? Question: Do you consider your EPF balance at any given point as part of your debt class of investments?\n\nContext: I checked my investment Allocation across asset classes and 63% of my current amount was in debt. 31% was in equity and 5% was bank balance.\nI do not own real estate or gold. I have not counted the emergency fund (6 months of my expenses) in this, which is in an FD.\n\n44% of my debt was in EPF. 27% of my debt is in PPF. 20% in an endowment policy that matures next year end and 9% in debt funds.\n\nSince a significant chunk of my salary (24% with my employer and my contribution) goes to EPF, I feel that my debt portion of total investments will always be high. I imagine this must be true for all salaried people. \n\nHow do you bring debt down or increase equity up when every month a big chunk keeps going into EPF? Do you not consider EPF part of your holdings as it is not actively being invested by you?\n\nAdvice is appreciated.\n\nProfile: I am married with a kid on the way, age 30 and with partially dependent parents. My wife is not working. Privately employed in Bangalore.","answer":"I don't consider EPF as a part of my overall portfolio. I don't even consider EPF contributions to be part of my salary. (ie) Suppose my actual salary is 50K per month and my EPF contribution is 5K per month, I consider my salary to be 45K per month because that's the amount I get. \n\nEPF is my 'safety net'. It's a safe investment that can be helpful if we need a lump sum of money for some special occasion (child's marriage\/studies, buying property, early retirement etc). So, I keep it out of my mind and focus on other investments. Currently, my portfolio is 95% equities &amp; 5% debt.\n\n\n&gt; How do you bring debt down or increase equity up when every month a big chunk keeps going into EPF?\n\nAs far as I know, there are two ways to handle this situation :\n\n1. Have an aggressive portfolio with minimal or no debt component. You can even go 100% equities, if you're willing to take the risk. Since EPF can be considered as the debt part, let the money be there and invest your remaining money in 'aggressive' investments.\n\n2. IIRC, we can withdraw EPF money if we have completed 5 years of employment. Periodically withdraw from EPF and eliminate it from your overall net worth. You can invest that money wherever you want, according to your asset allocation."}

{"question":"Active trading income vs. passive trading income I chatted with a few traders recently over at [r\/daytrading](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/daytrading\/) and came to an interesting conclusion.\n\nDay trading (going in and out within the same day) is seen as an active income for most, where you try yield a certain $ amount a day. If you don't trade, you don't earn that day. If it's geared toward another income, why not get a job where the odds are not so horribly stacked against you?\n\nI find the day trading mantra quite dangerous. It lures inexperienced traders. Every Tom, Dick and Harry will brag about his quick profit scheme in GME or whatever is hyped at the moment. That's why penny stocks work so well. Options are the exact same thing. Do the people over there really earn a consistent income? I doubt so. Day trading is hard.\n\nIsn't the whole point of putting money to work so you don't have to work? I always aim at passive income and trading should be a form of wealth-building. Building wealth means that we look at everything in terms of compound interest. You lose sight of the $ sign and focus on the % sign. **That's** where the big money is made \u2013 and it starts with a mindset. You also widen your time horizon and look at your performance over months and years.\n\nI see trend following as a way of making passive income on the side while you can pursue other productive activities. You're in a trade for multiple weeks to months and all you do is risk management with SLs. I follow trends in the NQ and am pretty much in the market around the clock. I'm either long or short, but never flat. The market does most of the work, and my part is to sit on my hands.\n\nI have trouble understanding why someone would work hard playing tiny swings if things could be so simple. Unless boredom is a real issue.","answer":"You\u2019re talking about two different active trading strategies. A passive trading strategy wouldn\u2019t be called trading it would be investing, buying to hold forever and collect dividends is passive. Buying to sell higher is active. \n\nI do both trend following and day trading with futures as well as revolving option credit spreads. Day trading is by far the biggest payout on risk, requires almost no prediction of direction with strict rules that take quick gains, and there is almost no associated stress since I\u2019m only in the market for 10min - 1hr. \n\nThere are pros and cons to every strategy, it\u2019s a nice feeling to be in a long term trend following position that is up 20% with a 5% trailing stop. Day trading feels a little like starting over every day so the psychology can be tough. I enter every day trade with a 2% risk for a .5% profit target, and I end my day trading at 1% gain or 4% loss. Only about 2 days per month are losers with this strategy. .5% compounded every trading day comes out to about 260% per year."}
{"question":"Capitalism is a system that is predicated on continual growth, and there is no equilibrium that it can achieve and maintain. We live on a planet of finite resources and capacity, how do you make sense of this? I\u2019m a finance major, I\u2019ve been studying this for years, and I see a big contradiction here. Some will say that technology will allow us to continue this system in a more efficient manner, but there is no system in the world that is or could be 100% efficient. Additionally, the constant growth required for capitalism to function properly also to some degree requires increasing population growth, and\/or increasing productivity, both of which are limited by human and technological capabilities.

{"question":"Where is the \"financial independence\" sub, not Retire Early? I've been looking for a reddit group that was excited about what they are doing while being focused on financial independence. I'm finding this sub, which is \"r\/financialindependence\" to be aggressively RE focused. The RE portion of FIRE is  depressing to read about and I find myself not wanting to visit this sub because of the amount of depressing, \"I hate my job, I'm 22 -how do I escape the rat race, what would you rather be doing\" type of posts. If you could do some NLP on this sub and rank it on level of depressing posts, this sub saddens me and I find myself not relating. Here's what my page is showing right now:\n\n\"**Fire due to inability to work with people\"**\n\n**\"I quit my job. Possibly FI. Maybe not RE.\"**\n\n**\"What steps have you taken to make your job more bearable as you move toward FIRE?\"**\n\n**\"Those who RE but went back to corporate... what did you sacrifice?\"**\n\nThis isn't a strike against those posts, I haven't even read them. I just find posts related to RE to be downright depressing. I don't like imagining someone wakes up everyday thinking, \"how do I get out of my current situation?\" What a terrible thing to read about when on a reddit break.  I'm missing a sub that talks about maximizing opportunities, happiness,  and entrepreneurship, then discussing the great things they have achieved with FI. Basically, where is the sub for those that are already FI? I suspect that sub would be more positive. Rather than spending time studying and reading about a thousand people struggling to find the way out of employment, where are the 1,000's of people that have found \"it\" or are having a party on their way to FIRE?\n\nMaybe Reddit needs a \"Positive Posts\" NLP filter.","answer":"The dirty secret is the origins of FIRE and the current rise is because many if not the vast majority of people hate their jobs.

Rather than slave away at meaningless jobs for heartless corporations with insufferable co-workers people quit to pursue passion projects and be alone or with close friends and family."}
{"question":"Anybody have experience with getting a black card? My sapphire reserve has been a good companion for a while but I'm hitting spends of 250k+\/yr across my cards. Don't know if I'm even close enough to getting a black card, and if I am, if it's worth it at all. I figure there has to be another step up from my sapphire reserve in credit card benefits though. So far I've just heard people talk about black cards through rumors. Would love to hear personal experiences.\n\nEdit: also to clarify this is personal spend. Not biz\n\n(Also I have no clue what to flair this)","answer":"Centurion upped the benefits this year to account for lack of travel spend - upon calling they also gave a credit against the annual fee.  \n\nIf you have centurion for bragging rights, then it is great for that, and for giving generally decent benefits across a wide swath of services.  However, any one of these services can be done better by specializing your providers.  For example, there are services that for around $5k per month will get you access to reservations and events at levels far higher than the centurion (think opening nights, exclusive galas, chef\u2019s tables, etc).\n\nBeyond that, it\u2019s really just a credit card with great benefits.  Where it has been very helpful is with crazy financial requests, not so much concierge requests you hear about on social media.  For example, if you need to put a $400k-$500k charge on the card when your normal monthly cadence is $50-70k a month, call up and no problem.  Another boring day at the office.  Try doing that with your retail card. \n\nAny private wealth card will provide a similar service, the difference is that with centurion those agents are always at the ready and you don\u2019t need to wake someone up from their deep slumber back in New York.  To be fair the platinum card offered much the same benefits on the financial side, so I\u2019d recommend starting there and seeing if you feel your life is missing anything.  If it is, you can call up the plat line and request a centurion card.  If you\u2019re FAT, you\u2019ll get that invite (they do quick asset verification and some other research). \n\nHope this helps."}

So, I have a few open questions for you, UKPersonalFinance - \n\n* How often do you check your investments?\n* Does how often you check your investments depend on the asset? i.e. house prices vs crypto\n* If you feel like you're checking performance too much, how do you help regulate yourself?","answer":"i like checking it because it\u2019s fun and i\u2019m interested. i\u2019ve seen it drop ~25% (coronavirus crash) and it didn\u2019t bother me at all (other than being mildly interesting!).\n\nas long as you have a complete understanding of what your investment is and the timeframe you are investing, check away. if you don\u2019t, i fancy stopping obsessive checking will not solve the underlying issue (eg, you\u2019ll surely and rightly check in a crash, and then what will you do?)"}
{"question":"How many have capitalized on the ETH dip? I've been slowly acquiring ETH from its fall from the high 400s. Everyone says \"buy the dip\" but has anyone actually been doing that? A lot of people get scared when they see the current price at $300, yet when ETH reached the high 1000s they regretted not buying at this price. My current buy ladder:\n\n$1000 at $425\n\n$500 at $380\n\n$1500 at $290\n\nHalf my purchases were from Coinbase (ETH takes a while to be received) and the other half was using my credit card on Bancor.\n\nWhat is everyone else up to?","answer":"I would, but can't.

{"question":"Trying to retire within 5 years (EXTREME EDITION) Yep you read the title right\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow I'm going to do it welp let me tell you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirstly I earn roughly about 80k before taxes I have no expenses besides necessities such as paying for my apartment and phone + other stuff. The rest goes to my savings account and some to the stock market (roughly 10% to bitcoin) recently I have realized that I do not enjoy what I do and unfortunately would rather go back to school. Although I also do not want to indebt my self too much. So i decided to produce as much as passive income as I can so that way I can concentrate in other projects that I would very much be excited to work on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm thinking of placing at least 1-1.8K every month into QYLG NUSI DIVO JEPI. In addition to that I would be re-investing the earning into VOO, SPY and QQQ. I also have the holy trinity of drinks but unsure if to sell KO SBX and PEP. The rest of the money will into an emergency fund and a savings account where I can liquidate this money as quick as I can in case of an emergency. Although I am willing into cutting a lot more for the sake of producing more passive income. \n\nAdditionally to that I do have a total of $4k stocks at the moment in various other companies although it seems that VOO, SPY, and QQQ would outperform them all so i would most likely sell them and place them into these 3 with DRIP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts?","answer":"I don't think you fully appreciate (a) how risky your portfolio is or (b) how poorly diversified it is (give me the benefit of a doubt before you get outraged by these statements). I personally don't care what you do - \"your money, your choice\" - but let me give you some food for thought as someone who has been a market participant for 20+ years and has spent more time obsessing over portfolio risk than is (likely) normal. I've watched folks lose their home taking on the kind of risks you're about to take on, I feel some moral duty to help you prevent a blow up (and if not you, someone else that may read this and identify similar exposure).\n\n(a) the four funds you have listed (QYLG, NUSI, DIVO, JEPI) all use a covered call strategy to generate the high-yield income which I'm going to guess factors heavily into your retirement calculation. As someone who has been a premium seller for a while, I have some bad news. These past 2 years have introduced a level of volatility into the market that has made this type of strategy *abnormally* lucrative &amp; successful. Options premium (which you receive via the dividend) is greater when volatility is high - this isn't 'my opinion', this is the mathematical reality of vega, a derivative off of the Black-Scholes model used to price options contracts. Following this to its logical conclusion, guess what will happen when the interest rate hikes *start* in 2022, capital liquidity dries up and volatility gets sucked out of the market? That's right, premium dries up, the dividend gets cut and we 'revert to the mean' of lower volatility. The key takeaway here is that you have a tremendous amount of vega risk applicable across all four of those funds. I would suggest you cut the current dividend yield of these in half and see how that changes your model and forecast.\n\n(b) Holding VOO and SPY is a complete redundancy - it's the same market, the S&amp;P500. Pick the one with the cheaper MER, you're not gaining anything here by holding both; they are near-perfect correlates. QQQ probably has some additional exposure, although if you take the time to look at the holdings of SPY\/VOO and compare them to QQQ you will likely find that the biggest holdings in QQQ (i.e. tech giants) are already represented in SPY\/VOO. But the redundancy is a secondary issue - you're holding just the US stock market and essentially praying that it continues the unprecedented bull run it has had over the last 10+ years (a bull run subsidized by the Fed via QE and lax monetary policy). You're in for a very unpleasant surprise when the system shock (inevitably) shows up; and I'm talking about a proper, non V-shaped, prolonged shock of multi-year (not months-long) duration. Those of us in the market of 2001 or 2007 got a taste; watching 30-50% of your US market value disappear is an interesting experience. All this 'buy the dip', 'diamond hands' bullshit goes out the window real quick - try shoveling money into the market for 3 years (and watching it disappear) then tell me about 'Lambos on the moon'; 'bus fare on Earth' seems barely attainable from your portfolio. The key takeaway here is this: you have max geographical risk in this portfolio, there is no geographical or asset class diversity to speak of. Can you get lucky? Sure - that's why lottery tickets are sold; they're just not what I would use as the basis for my retirement plan.\n\n(c) Are those drink manufacturers not represented in SPY\/VOO\/QQQ? KO is for sure, I assume PEP is as well. Again, unnecessary redundancy with no diversification benefit.\n\nThese are all things that are *glaringly* obvious to an idiot like me, on an Internet forum. Take this as well intentioned feedback - spend some time to understand how capital markets and investment instruments (upon which you have built your retirement plans) operate. Your retirement strategy is, in a nutshell, is to get lucky; what happens if you don't?\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, there are some young punks with stupid haircuts loitering on my lawn."}
{"question":"Company flied me out for interview then ghosted me EDIT: *flew\n\nI live in San Jose, CA and I applied for a job in Denver, CO for a senior level position.

{"question":"Ethereum is the superior coin, prove me wrong. Lately I have been on a major ETH kick, throwing huge amounts on money at the coin convinced it cannot fail. I am hoping one of you have some logical reason and insight that might rebalance my expectations about ETH and bring my frame of thinking back down to earth, or if not solidify my current state of mind that ETH is the future of crypto currency and offers more value to the world than BTC or other alt coins. \n\nSuperiority over alt coins:\n\n1. ETH being one of the top crypto currencies in the world makes it an easy choice when considering any digital asset; it has proven its legitimacy and built a thick layer of confidence over the years that will be hard to break in to the future.\n\n2. Smart contracts look to change the landscape of financial markets, or really any area today where money or consensus is exchanged between two parties regardless of application. This one is huge I cannot stress enough how valuable smart contracts are to the future of the world.\n\n3. Though other coins have hit the stage offering smart contract functionality, and even offering higher throughput when compared to ETH, the prospect of consensus layer (ETH 2.0) which claims to offer 100,000 transaction per second (Google suggest that Visa can handle 24,000 transaction per second?). This enormous increase in transaction processing would put ETH in the number 1 seat for throughput and scalability. Unlocking the endless potential for smart contracts and transactions in general.\n\n4. Reliability is a big factor for me, despite some of these really interesting new coins that offer a comparable network all seems to have a struggle adjusting to their popularity and in a pretty bad way. ETH though not susceptible to similar experiences has already had its share of discovery and has perhaps matured to a more reliable and dependable network.\n\n5. The ETH development team is perhaps one of the most respected and trusted block chain development teams in the world. Over the years this team has garnered a huge amount of respect in the crypto community. This makes me feel that I am in pretty good hands and that is worth something.\n\nSuperiority over BTC: \n\nDespite BTC being the big dog on the block and accepted by most as the gold standard of crypto, I see many reasons why ETH is a far better option.\n\n6. True Value - BTC fights a lot of battles in regards to its true value, many will argue that BTC has no real value and offers nothing but a collective agreement that it is valuable (I don\u2019t agree with this btw), you know like gold or diamonds, things we have all agreed are valuable.... However stupid this argument is there is some truth in the logic, as gold can still be used in maybe industrial applications resulting in value outside of just backing a currency (which it doesn\u2019t even do anymore in some cases). This argument against BTC true value cannot be applied to ETH as in addition to being an asset it also offers utility, if we all agree ETH was useless as an asset what we could not deny is the its usefulness as a utility due to smart contract functionality.\n\n7. We know who created ETH. Early on and perhaps still today people find comfort in the fact that BTCs creator is anonymous (or dead, or maybe not anonymous? who knows?) this seemed pretty cool in 2017 when the world started to find real interest in block chain and decentralization. However I feel as time has passed this has become a hindrance for BTC, if the last couple years have taught us anything it\u2019s that crypto currency needs flexibility to become truly useful and to be applied in any mainstream setting. It is my personal opinion that knowing a dedicated development team backs a product and is pushing to improve it leave me with this a sense that BTC will become the Commodore 64 of the crypto world in the next 10 years with no true direction or guidance. ETH will become the Xbox, or PlayStation.\n\n8. Out of reach, growth potential - Many claim BTC is going to between $100,000 and $500,000 in the next X number of years; though this may be true normal people cannot acquire enough BTC to allow them to buy that Lambo. ETH however is still only 3k at time of writing this, which gives us little guys a fighting chance of getting in early (or sooner). Imagine ETH is realized to its full potential with Defi, NFTs, governance, or any other future application and it can also transact 100k transactions per second. What\u2019s not to say ETH will be worth 40,000 or even 100,000 in future? In this regard ETH could much more easily double, triple, quadruple, rinse and repeat. currently the total supply is of ETH is in the 120 million range and BTC is 21 million, today if you reduced the supply of ETH to match that of BTC each ETH would be 15k, still far below the value of where BTC sits, this is insane, how ETH is currently 3 times less valuable than BTC while offering so much more?!\n\nAs a software engineer with a solid understanding of crypto, block chain, and smart contracts it feels impossible for me to accept that ETHs true value has been recognized and I know that its full potential far exceeds that\u2019s of BTC or any crypto currency to date. I know with depth how a lot of applications work, I think this makes it a bit easier for me to see how ETH could be used is an endless amount of ways to benefit nearly all industries. My go to example is my interpretation of DeFi as a trustless financial Internet thinks of the opportunities this presents to developers, businesses, entrepreneurs, or any of us as individuals. Block chain will allow the collective voice of the world to be heard without a filter and transact with freedom so we can create the world we truly desire.\n\nIf you made it this far I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts as to why any logic I have outlined above is either flat out wrong, misunderstood, or irrelevant to the success of ETH.","answer":"People complain about gas fees but don't understand that what block chains do is sell block space. That space fills up with more usage, no matter the chain. Layer 2 is where users transact and layer 1 is the settlement layer. Ethereum is ahead of the game with this already. \n\nI can do all my defi stuff already and pay under a dollar in fees with Ethereum security!!!"}

{"question":"How Exactly Does Wall Street Affect The Economy? (educate me)  I've recently taken on a big interest in economics, more specifically being the finance aspect of it, and I have to say that I've learned a lot from the economics community here. However, there is one topic that I see comes up in the comments a lot, and it's a subject I don't quite understand in its relation to how it actually affects the economy. That subject being Wall Street.\n\nFrom what I understand, Wall Street is a colloquial term that represents the investment sector of America in its relation to the stock market and not just the physical place itself. Stocks are shares of companies. People who buy and sell stocks are investors. And hedge funds are investment firms.\n\nStocks are a means of generating more revenue for a company. Company stock prices increase when the company does well because more investors want the stock, and decrease when it does bad because no one wants to invest in a crappy company. The investment sector gets hit hard when hedge funds and investors make bad investment decisions. \n\nSo how does Wall Street's bad investment decisions end up affecting me? I neither work for an investment firm nor have any money in one. How does this eventually become my problem when it seems like the only money Wall Street is losing is its own?\n\nnote: it's hard to convey attitude through text, and I've been told I have a \"hostile\" way of writing things. I don't know how to not do this, so understand that I'm not looking to argue with anyone. I'm making this thread to be educated.\n\n","answer":"There's also a \"Wealth Effect\" that takes place when the market is up.  People see their investments\/retirement accounts going up and feel more comfortable spending money now. This was prevalent in the late 90s.  As people spend more, companies take in more revenue and in short it becomes sort of a self fulfilling prophecy for a while.  "}
{"question":"Nvidia pays $5.5 million for allegedly hiding how many gaming GPUs were sold to crypto miners Link to article from [The Verge](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2022\/5\/6\/23059930\/nvidia-sec-charges-fine-settlement-gaming-gpu-crypto-mining)\n\n\"Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to \u201cgaming,\u201d hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn\u2019t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.\n\nThe charges stem from Nvidia\u2019s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. \u201cThe company\u2019s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,\u201d the order says.\n\nGiven the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia\u2019s sales numbers didn\u2019t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company\u2019s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,\u201d the SEC alleges.\n\nDespite this, Nvidia didn\u2019t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division\u2019s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors\u2019 anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.\n\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company\u2019s business in a key market,\u201d says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. \u201cAll issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.\u201d\"","answer":"Lol there net income works out to about $24mm per day.

{"question":"What do you say to those who label dividend stocks as useless to anyone who doesn't *need* the income? ie. retired folks. As someone relatively young and relatively new to investing (28yo, 1 year into researching) I'm feeling quite an internal tug-o-war with regard to which path will lead to optimal returns when building an investment portfolio for retirement. \n\nDividend investors swear by DRIPs and the power of compound interest.\n\nYet growth investors love to make the case that unless you need the income now, you'd be better off hitching your wagon to growth stocks\/ETFS for a chance at much higher returns than dividend or dividend growth stocks. (I'm operating under a 30 year time horizon)\n\nIs it simply a matter of personal preference, risk tolerance, and time horizon?\n\nCould the case be made that yes, growth stocks have the potential to far surpass returns of dividend paying stocks, so higher risk\/higher reward, whereas dividend stocks are less volatile and would be less risky with a higher chance of safe, respectable gains?\n\nUltimately is it safe to say that *there is no wrong answer?*\n\nAssuming sufficient diversification through different industries, markets, and market caps, is there a case to be made for a clear-cut winner between someone investing 100% in dividends, 0% in dividends, or anything in between?\n\nAnything wrong with a 50\/50 approach?","answer":"Yes, the growth crowd promotes the superiority of their strategy due to the *chance* at higher returns.  If the share price skyrockets, you win!  The growth company you choose might become the next Amazon... but it also might become the next Enron.  That's what chance is all about.  It's your money; put it wherever you like.\n\nOTOH, the dividend crowd promotes their approach due to its significantly reduced volatility.  I believe it was Peter Lynch who said, it is far easier to predict a company's future dividend payouts than it is to predict a company's future share price.  Indeed, despite the market in general being down 20%, 30% or more, not only do my dividend payments keep rolling in month after month, they are actually *increasing*.  This definitely promotes sleeping well at night, particularly to those who are living off the income.\n\nI don't need the dividend income yet.  However, I am following the Chowder method of building up the income now, relying on time + dividend growth to compound my income for when I *will* need it.  My 401k and HSA both invest entirely in low-cost index funds because that is my only option in those accounts.  My Roth IRA, however, is much more flexible and I have focused it solely on generating dividend income.  At my current rate of growth and investing, by the time I retire I might not need my 401k or HSA at all--my dividend payouts will likely be large enough to support me entirely.  That's my goal, anyway."}

Maybe Saudi Arabia cutting a deal whereas they increase production with US\/EU dropping hopes of reviving the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nWhat other events would need to happen?

{"question":"Family Educational Trust So question to the group as it appears impossible to find information online due to the keywords. \n\nIs there a way \/ playbook to set up an educational trust for (extended) family members?\n\nBackground: Most of my extended family was and is blue collar. I personally see and have witnessed how education can be the gateway to a better life and new opportunities. However, people follow examples and tend to short change what is possible for themselves if it\u2019s in front of their face. I\u2019ve witnessed this with my own family members discounted what may be possible for them, even though I found them incredibly intelligent and capable. \n\nMy parents did a bit better financially\/educationally and one thing that always irked me a bit was seeing how people around me growing always got a leg up and expected to enter University and land a good job. Whereas many members of my family in small towns didn\u2019t know or have the same expectations or support. And a lot of \u201coh, no way we could afford that.\u201d I\u2019d like work on correcting that a bit. \n\nWhat I want to do: I\u2019d like to set up a trust or scholarship for extended family members. This would be available to any being able to show direct bloodline with me, including children of cousins. It would be target towards undergraduate education or technical trade school (industrial electrician, etc). \n\nWhy: A little bit of help goes a long way. Also if people know it\u2019s there and in their family, maybe their expectations raise. Also if it\u2019s via a trust\/scholarship, it feels and I think would be less likely to be interpreted as a hand-out - family is very proud and I get scolded if I try to buy more than my share beers at the bar. \n\nAny thoughts or directions you could point me in?","answer":"I strongly recommending setting it up in such a way where they are only eligible for payout upon successful completion of the program. This not only gives more time for assets to accrue while in trust, but also incentivizes completion of the program. Yes, their loans will accumulate interest while they\u2019re in school... but having loans hang over their head is a fantastic motivator."}

Taiko + zkEVM\n\nIn [Q3\/2021 we announced](https:\/\/medium.loopring.io\/loopring-quarterly-update-2021-q3-bd083d94ca17) that we were contributing to a new zkEVM core design alongside the Ethereum Foundation, and much progress has been made.\n\nSince then, [Taiko](https:\/\/taiko.xyz\/), a new team has formed to build and expand upon this zkEVM design.\n\n## Why the separate team + token?\n\n**There are two main reasons why this effort required the formation of a separate team and token:**\n\n* Neutrality + strategic focus  \u2014 For this zkEVM to succeed it would need to be credibly neutral,  censorship resistant, permissionless, and decentralized. Yet some of  these principles came at odds with the realities of Loopring\u2019s existing  and established products. Specifically, deploying Loopring\u2019s apps atop  its zkEVM could conceivably conflict with the network\u2019s neutrality. With  these potential conflicts of interest, others would likely perceive  Loopring to favor its own applications to theirs. This would deter  communities and developers from deploying their applications onto  Loopring\u2019s general purpose chain, and pose a great risk to bootstrapping  a thriving network. The new team allows for credible neutrality as well  as the ability to strategically focus on new target markets (developer  communities, as opposed to end-users) in order to properly compete with  other general-purpose rollups.\n\n&gt;*\u201c\\[\u2026\\]when building mechanisms that decide high-stakes outcomes, it\u2019s very important for those mechanisms to be credibly neutral.\u201d \u2014 Vitalik*\n\n* Max decentralization  \u2014in order to achieve strong decentralization at the onset and over  time, a new (inflationary) token model would be needed. This new token  and token model would allow for the network to properly incentivize a  diverse and vast group of proposers and provers. Additionally, it would  enable the project to be self-sustainable over time by keeping the DAO  resources available to incentivize and attract builders, projects, and  other contributors.\n\nWhile the efforts must be  separate, we are happy to share that the Loopring community will be an  important component in helping bootstrap the Taiko network and token  distribution. Taiko is still in the early stages; the team is focused on  building the layer 2 infrastructure and will share details as they get  closer to a testnet launch.\n\n\\---\n\nTl:DRS: \nNow, from reading this, together with yesterdays news, its all so clear to me. From the very beginning everything was planned out, Matthew would leave Loopring to help Gamestop assemble their blockchain team and build. Steve would be appointed CEO of Loopring when Daniel left to start up Taiko, then when Gamestop Blockchain was all set, Matthew would return to his old friend and mentor, to help doing it all again, building Taiko, and the mass adoption to web3.\n\nThis is just the beginning..\n\nEdit: \nAll credit goes to: u\/pissfestmcgee\n\nTake a look at this simulation, (Taiko) TYCO RC super rebound..!  that\u2019s how you spell RC.. https:\/\/youtu.be\/jGZ6z4FamuA\n\nCrazy\ud83d\ude02","answer":"This is how I explained him leaving to the one person in my life that knows about this whole thing and was panicky yesterday when he read that.

{"question":"Travel\/experiences vs Career in 20s Hey all, looking for a bit of advice and some of your stories. Long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nFirstly, I recognise my privilege of even being able to entertain these ideas and not having to support a family straight out of uni and living in a country where I have these liberties, I'm definitely aware of it.\n\nGrew up as a daughter an immigrant household so working hard was paramount, I did really well in schooling (public) and uni and was really driven and got into a good degree (Law) and have a good grad job lined up in consulting with a set career path, but after having done internships in the corporate sector, I realised it's not all that it was cut out to be. Combined with having gone on exchange prior to COVID in Europe and travelling, I feel like I've realised there's so much more out there than slogging away my best years.\n\nConsulting is stimulating enough, I know its a set career path that will set me up well when I exit and give me a comfortable life, but most people I meet who have been in the industry for years end up hating their lives and they all wished they didn't rush into it.\n\nI realise not grinding away at a corporate career from the get go will delay my goals of hitting FIRE and owning a house, but I don't think I'll ever regret making memories and travelling the world and doing all the cliche stuff in your 20s that people talk about either.\n\nCombined with the fact that home ownership in Melb\/Syd is quickly becoming a mirage for people my age, factors like climate change and global warming, inflation, political instability around the world, who knows what the world will look like in 20 - 30 years when I may be rich from grinding away at the expense of living life in my 20s.\n\nAny stories\/experiences\/advice from other people who were high flyers and realised it ain't all that? Or conversely, any of these people who don't regret going into their hotshot careers?","answer":"Wont give you a long winded write up but I did this in my 20's. Went on a round the world backpacking trip for a year and made it back 6 years later. Stopped in London and started a 2nd career there which set me up for life. Having the base in London also allowed me to have many weekends away and longer holidays. So many life experiences and great memories.\n\nCame back in my early 30's and the career boomed, hitting peak earning potential in my 40's which also allowed me to get my super up to a good level and to allow me to FIRE.\n\nLooking back at it 20 years later I am thankful I did it whilst young and at peak health. I often smile when a memory from then is triggered."}

{"question":"Are all inclusive resorts worth it compared to itemizing each part of a trip? Trying to decide if all inclusive resorts are generally worth it comparatively.\n\nEdit: Thanks you for all the suggestions and reply\u2019s. I do enjoy booze, deserts and being lazy so all inclusive may just be for me.","answer":"YMMV. I'm currently at an all inclusive in Punta Cana we got through Costco. Without the plane tickets it was approx. $2500 for 2 people,10 days, and includes all meals, alcohol, and a bunch of activities. Frankly, I couldn't be happier about not having to worry about extra costs, and most hotels I would enjoy (4 stars ish) would charge $250 a night anyway. You can obviously add a bunch of extras, but for what it is, I found it to be a good deal. Oh, and I'll get a $125 Costco shopping card after all is said and done."}
{"question":"Just want to say Congratulations to all the HODLers (as a non-HODLer) I come here as an investor who doesn't own any bitcoin\n\nMany of the guys over at r\/investing are salty as fuck and throwing around the usual 'bubble', 'greater fools' ya-da ya-da\n\nFor years they stood on the sidelines and mocked HODLers during the bad times. I hoped that they would at least have the integrity to acknowledge if things didn't go as they predicted. Sadly, it seems many are just going to keep making the same prediction, waiting to gloat the one time they get it right. Ironically, they hate it when people do this with stock market crashes\n\nSo I just want to recognise your achievement on getting to a point many said you never would reach. Anyone who has had the belief and discipline to HODL through thick and thin deserves congratulations on those diamond hands\n\nI appreciate many of you are not doing this as a speculative investment and you do not care what the price is doing at any given time. So I understand my congratulations will mean little to you\n\nNonetheless, well done\n\nNow keep HODLing","answer":"Just wanted to say that I bet a coworker of mine that bitcoin would surpass $20,000 before June 2021. This was sometime last year. He said no way would it ever reach that high. Feels good, man.  \n\n\nEdit - hey thanks for the award, btw"}
{"question":"Very Productive Year, Disappointing Raise, Boss Said He Had Too Many \"Good\" Employees I had a really great year with my company (very large 50000+ employees), deployed 2 new initiatives and was a major part of my department's bi-annual audit.  We got the best scores ever, and both my boss and his boss stated that it was in large part due to the information I was able to provide.\n\nMy department is broken up into teams, and the team that I'm on consists of my boss and 4 others.  I have the highest rank of the other team members, although some have been here longer than me.  I am also the only woman on my team, and the highest ranking woman in the department.\n  \nWhen the written annual review came up, my boss marked \"exceptional\" or \"outstanding\" for all of my categories.  This week, we got our raises, and mine was very disappointing.  With the scale being 0-4%, I got exactly 2%.  In the past years here, I've never gotten lower than 2.5%, usually 3%, and I've never had a busier or more productive year than 2018.  I honestly thought the past year was my best ever here, and that my raise would be at least 3%.  \n\nIn recent calls, my boss has made comments along the lines of how he has such a great team, and how everyone has exceeded their goals.  I used to be a manager (at another company), so I understand the whole \"pool of percentages\" and that things have to be divided fairly (from the manager's perspective).  However, I have always believed that each employee is an individual and should be evaluated as such.  If everyone had an outstanding year, then everyone should receive and \"outstanding\" percentage increase.    \n\nWe do not work in the same office or even the same state.  I call at least once a week (usually goes to VM), send weekly updates on progress, and email every day (about something or nothing), just to stay in touch.  I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to use the remote aspect and lesser communication as part of the reason \u2013 however he is the one who consistently cancels our weekly calls and does not answer emails.  \n\nHe is going to call me later today to discuss.  I know there is no way to change this now, but please help me calm down and determine the right things to say.\n\nUpdate:  First, thank you to every single one of you for taking the time to respond.  I have been reading through all of the posts and seriously appreciate your opinions.  \n\nMy boss called a little while ago.  I told him I was surprised and disappointed in the increase amount, given the exceptional work \u201cwe\u201d had done.  He said that everyone on our team was given 2%, that the amount was set by our CIO and the only way to give anyone more would mean someone would get less.   \n\nHe also \u201creminded\u201d me that I am the only one on our team (besides him) that gets a bonus.  That comment has led me to believe that I in fact was given more than 2%, and he took my extra and divided it among the others on my team.  Whatever.  Today has been an eye-opener for me, for sure.\n\nI\u2019ve updated LinkedIn and turned on recruitment.  At my age and in my circumstances, changing jobs isn\u2019t a picnic.  It may all come to nothing, but who knows.","answer":"It sounds like you're upset that you weren't recognized for the work you did. This is 100% legitimate, and I've been there before. It's not really about a 1% difference in salary, because that's peanuts.\n\nI think it's fair to express that you know that you crushed it this year and wanted to be recognized (via your raise) for how well you performed. I would make sure you've given enough time for your emotions to cool off, though, because you don't want to come across as emotionally charged or \"unreasonable\" just because you feel strongly about it (which you should).\n\nIt's in your boss's best interest to ensure you feel rewarded for good performance, because employees who don't get rewarded based on good merit tend to leave.\n\nAlso if you haven't interviewed around a bit, it never hurts to see what your worth is in your area. The biggest raises usually come from switching companies."}

{"question":"Golf Simulators I love to golf. Unfortunately, my schedule does not love me golfing. With family and work, I have very few opportunities to make my way to the course and spend the 4+ hours there. Enter my somewhat crazy idea... buy a golf simulator. I'm not talking about the ones that run a few grand and aren't particularly accurate. I'm thinking of spending the $50k+ for a top of the line simulator.\n\nObviously, these aren't accessible to most folks (hence why I'm posting here) and would likely be the only meaningful chance I'd have to golf on a regular basis -- maybe an hour or two at a time. It also seems like it'd be a fun way to host friends, have a bit of side action while watching a game\/grilling, etc. For those (if any) who have used and\/or own one, was it worth it? Do you find yourself actually using them? I'm aware there are golf sim communities online, but asking them is like asking an audiophile about headphones -- the expectations and desired features are just completely different. I'm looking for casual fun that's accurate, not to fine tune my swing or anything.\n\nAside: I understand this is a very niche topic, so I completely understand if the mods close this.","answer":"I've played on a bunch and they all have pros\/cons.

I want to tell you how it went, in case there's anyone here that wants to know.\n\nToday, I ran Door Dash and Uber Eats simultaneously. I did not take multiple orders at a time. I took one order at a time. To be clear, I accepted a delivery, picked up the food, delivered the food, and then I waited for my next delivery.\n\nI drive a Ford F-150 with a 5.4L Triton V8 engine.\n\nThe amount of time that I was online delivering or waiting for one from either app puts me at a 6-hour day.\n\nMy earnings for my 6-hour day were: $85.94\n\nThat would mean I averaged $14.32 an hour.\n\nI used about a quarter tank of gas to do this.\n\nA quarter tank is probably $15 right now, so I'm down to $70.94.\n\nThat means I averaged about $11.82 an hour. I beat minimum wage in the state of Florida.\n\nI did way more Uber Eats deliveries than I did Door Dash deliveries. Most of my tips were around $5. I tried to make sure there was more money than miles on the delivery. I didn't have much trouble at the restaurants and us Floridians don't like to be bothered so only one person wanted me to hand them their order. Everyone else wanted me to drop it off at the door and leave which is absolutely perfect for me.\n\nI 100% absolutely did NOT screw around today. When I was running, I was running. I didn't stand and say hello and talk to anyone. Most of my deliveries were sitting on the counter when I got there to pick them up. It was easy. There was no piddling and taking my time and not being serious.\n\nMy goal for the day was $100 minimum. It's 4:45 right now, so I'll probably make my $100, because I may go back out again for a few more.\n\n\\*This is me speculating now.\\*\n\n If I can make $85 a day, 5 days a week, I can cover my base living expenses and I can get out of the financial turmoil that I'm in really quickly, because my other money will be mine. This could very well be a game changer for me.\n\nI made this kind of money on my very first day, having never been exposed to it at all, not understanding the app or how the process works, without overlapping any orders or anything. This was Day 1 for me with zero experience. I did one single order at a time. I turned down 4 or 5 orders today, because I was already delivering some food. I can only imagine that I will only get better at it. I am going to be praying that this is my game changer.\n\nEnough of me preaching and getting excited...\n\nHow much do you make a day?

{"question":"Financial \"Therapy\" for FatFire Couples? Throwaway account (I've posted here before but have chatted with people using my real name). \n\nI'm looking for financial resource that is geared towards \"fatfire\" couples on how they approach spending money if their spouse disagrees.  We've discussed with our therapist to no avail.  \n\nWe do everything we want within reason - kids and their school being the limiting factor. We do set goals\/wants and focus on achieving them. My wife is extremely frugal - she's a giant Nordstrom rack, Marshals, TJ Maxx fan.  We don't waste food. It's a product of her upbringing and I LOVE it... but only sometimes. \n\nAbout every 6-months she'll take a deep dive into our credit cards and it almost always turns into a pretty large fight.  She gets angry when I spend money on things she doesn't feel are important or maybe excessive. An example would be the amount of money I spend on golf.  It's less than .5% of my yearly take home (non-investment income) but I'm a high earner so out of context it's kind of a big number (+50K a year).  She hates that I valet the car or that I buy expensive wine at dinner.  In total it's not meaningful IMO but to her it is. \n\nI could play less expensive golf but I like the courses I play. (I'm on the waiting list at two clubs). I could drink less expensive wine but I love wine. I'd probably have the same amount of fun and enjoyment but it's my splurge and I enjoy doing it. \n\nI've tried explaining to her in percentages, literally made graphs of what we do versus most people. We save more than 50% of my take home each year.  At the end of the day we get into week long arguments because of how I choose to spend less than 1% of my income and it drives me nuts. \n\nIn fairness, when I was single I was nuts with money, thats when we met. Spent money on moronic shit but it was my money at the time. Lesson learned but she remembers that and I think it concerns her.  \n\nAnd good resources?","answer":"Why not pick an annual amount of money that each of you can spend without any input from the other - whatever makes sense for your budget. Then have that transferred monthly to separate accounts. You can have separate credit cards that you pay out of this account if needed. You spend from that account on the things she doesn't find \"worth it\" like golf, valet, wine, whatever. She can spend, save, or invest her equivalent amount as she sees fit. It gives you each what makes you happy - for you, spending on luxuries you enjoy, for her the additional emotional security of larger savings\/investment of her own."}
{"question":"Does margin of safety decrease if the price of your holding goes up? I understand the concept of requiring a margin of safety when you purchase a stock, as this gives you cushion for adverse and unforeseen circumstances. Let's say you have a holding that you bought when it was undervalued and provided a margin of safety. Now let's say that the stock's price rose substantially such that at the new price it does not reflect a margin of safety. At this point, should you sell the stock because its price is no longer 'undervalued' and no longer has a'margin of safety'? Or should you consider your cost basis and continue to hold the now 'fairly valued' stock?","answer":"That depends on you too be honest. Theoretically when the price of a stock reaches its intrinsic value then there is no margin of safety (it\u2019s at \u201cequilibrium\u201d to use economic jargon).

The secret ingredient is double entry book-keeping. Also, I noticed that there is quite some misunderstanding in here when it comes to as how a balance sheet actually works. I pointed this out when some very wrong statements regarding bank balance sheets were made, but this did not get any traction at that time. If somebody is interested in an ELIA for how to fucking read a balance sheet and why it looks like it looks, leave a comment.\n\nAlso, financial statements are typically audited by a third party like Ernst Young, PriceWaterhouse, etc. (LOL). Well, let's just say that's not a safeguard against fuckery (looking at you, Wirecard), but at least somebody is kinda looking over it.\n\nI really feel like a deep dive into the financial statements of those companies who we all believe are short GME has not gotten enough love. Here's a couple of things that I found.\n\nCitadel Securities LLC is the broker dealer arm of Citadel (not the hedge fund). It is also the market maker for GameStop shares. If will refer to that company as CS from now on.\n\nHere's the balance sheet of CS as of Dec 31 2020:\n\nSource: [https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001616344-21-000004\/](https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001616344-21-000004\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3rpks9c447i71.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e28e618482b9a4b2d623b2b77dda26480569813\n\nHere's the balance sheet as per Dec 31 2019:\n\nSource: [https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001146184-20-000006\/](https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001146184-20-000006\/)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zirjovyp47i71.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a90434c24c2b6548e3406c4be7078f2b8e9a02c\n\nAnd 2018:\n\nSource: [https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001146184-19-000002\/](https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001146184-19-000002\/)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3ijg6hyz47i71.png?width=810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f7d83422d77c8bbac86dccf2136deb036a7e55\n\nThe years before 2018 always hover around the 30bn $ total asset mark.\n\nSo, CS increased the securities that they hold from 26bn $ to 66bn$. Those securities are accounted for at fair value, which means:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wrcvbly367i71.png?width=443&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8343b604c60385be2e5e43e261765c383243720\n\nSo, it's based on market value. Ok, we had a huge fucking bull market in 2020, right, so if you hold shares in 2020 that value should have increase by what, 30-60%? However, this does not explain the increase in the position if we take a look at the liabilities and member's capital.\n\nMember's capital increased by 1.5bn $ only. (Unfortunately those filings do not include a profit and loss statement that you could study to understand where this increase exactly came from.. it might be profits for the period of 2020, capital increase, etc).\n\nThe lion's share of their increase in assets was financed with debt, and in particular by an increase in the position of \"securities sold, not yet purchased, at fair value\" by 32bn$. So what the fuck is this position, do you ask? It's their fucking shorts. So, this increase might be explained by some losses they have incurred but not closed out in their short positions held before, but I would assume that the majority comes from increases in the volume of shorts.\n\nThey are using shorting to raise money to go out and acquire other securities.\n\nHere's a couple of other interesting things that I found:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iiya3wpy97i71.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=782b0db9b602e1b5314586cdfd0751fbb03b2c68\n\nSo they borrow securities to cover short positions and then - if applicable - net those liabilities out so that they will not show up in full amount on their balance sheet. Well, and they will do this business with associated broker dealers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qmns4ylca7i71.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8204a251a275f9f3d5328e499a4accc8e62fe9b\n\nThis one here caught my attention:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ajwszvb6b7i71.png?width=433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54e5d3cf8b21b49df7a3596b1323790b4e1afb77\n\nOn page 14, under the headline \"Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements\" it is mentioned that \"it is possible that the terms of these transactions are not the same as those that would result from transactions among unrelated parties.\" (see screenshot above)\n\nI find it remarkable that that statement is made under the \"reverse repurchase and repurchase\" paragraph and not under the \"expenses\" paragraph, where it would expect such statement to be made if it only would cover pricing of services. It seems to relate to the actual pricing of transactions. The involved parties are CSIN (Citadel Securities Institutional LLC - ) and CSSF (Citadel Securities Swap Dealer LLC).\n\nCSIN is an affiliated broker dealer, that engages in \"options order routing as well as trades U.S. government securities and equities with institutional and broker and dealer clients.\"\n\nCS engages in \"market making and liquidity provision in  U.S. options,  equities, government securities, and foreign exchange products, as well as trade execution.\"\n\nWe know that market makers have some special exemptions when it comes to shorting as we have learned from RegSho:\n\nSource: [https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/investor\/pubs\/regsho.htm](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/investor\/pubs\/regsho.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yx5vhsmye7i71.png?width=529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9072cf040592f5d5051f17dd45f076e7f06cfbad\n\nSo... CS is GameStop's market maker. They can naked short in bona fide market making. The enter into reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements with affiliated broker dealers whose terms \"are not the same as those from transactions among unrelated parties and such difference could be material\". And, those terms typically include the possibility for rehypothecation, for both reverse repurchase and repurchase transactions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/r7rdn2zpf7i71.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=674ea64d87341a65f5c3320fae4aa097cc020103\n\nThey use securities received to cover short positions.\n\nSo CS can pledge securities to CSIN who then can pledge the same security to CSSF who can then pledge if back to CS? And those transaction could be not reflecting market pricing? And the positions can be netted out between the participants, even with a massive possibility of rehypothecation between three affiliated parties? (the merry-go-around)\n\nWhat the actual fuck.\n\nTL;DR: Citadel sets it own terms for transactions between different broker dealer businesses they operate. They use reverse repurchase and repurchase agreement and use securities received to cover short position. Terms of those agreements between the affiliated parties might be of material difference. I haven't seen much attention given to this topic but the financial statements seem to point in that direction.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80HODL.

So, I just have some YouTube videos uploaded about playing Minecraft, so I think you are confusing me with somebody (not even joking).\n\nI totally agree with you: Transactions with related parties are very common, but I believe very often this is where you can actually hide stuff best.\n\nAn example: Let's say you have an asset on your balance sheet that starts to stink. For the lulz: A banana. You bought the banana two years ago for 1m $. You auditor looked at, thinking: well, that's a hella expensive banana, but it's fresh, so let's not question it. Time passes and what a surprise: Nobody is buying the fucking banana from you for 1m$.. and, it really starts looking like shit, it's old and u\/rick_of_spades was playing around with it. Yikes, what is the auditor going to say about the banana? He might wanna make me reasses the value of it. So let's sell the banana to a related party (my wife's boyfriend), he said that he will happily pay 1m$ for it. Time passes and the auditor shows up and he is really keen to know what happened to the 1m$ banana in my inventory. Good news, I no longer have it, but now I have a 1m$ receivables toward an affiliate party, but don't worry... it's really worth 1m$, you will see it by end of next year, when it's gone for something else lol.\n\nAlso, this item I personally find spicy in combination with two other statements: Namely the rehypothecation statement (everything I receive I will just use over and over again) and that transactions between parties might not be at market value (or arm's length as it is called). The latter might have a material impact. So, in my example above, we might agree that nobody in a market transaction would pay 1m$ for that stinky banana. So, the right thing to would be to throw the fucker away and write off 1m$ (leading to a loss of 1m$, eating up my equity, etc.). Since the transaction to my wife's boyfriend however is not at arm's length (I made him pay 1m$ because he loves my cute little butt), I avoided that.\n\nTypically when doing transactions with related parties you will look to do them at arm's length. There are many implications when this is not done (moving profits between companies, not valuing things correctly on your balance sheet, etc.). The statement says that this might be the case, it's not saying that it is happening.\n\nThe combination of those three things just shows that this is a wonderful way to pass shares around between related parties basically indefinitely and due to netting agreements not let them show up in your balance sheet. If I needed a way to kick \"the can down the road\", that might be a neat place to start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: So, a couple of people are interested in a short ELIA regarding how a balance sheet works. Aight, imma draw one up, gimme a couple of days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 4: \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/80ozrl7cwai71.jpg?width=652&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cb444b603abf3ac5a779c2d117389ac4ba95111","answer":"I audit for a living - meaning - I literally am the guy making these and putting them on the SEC website.

The value of our home is approximately $900k in the DFW area (is DFW MCOL?)  I am thinking it will cost approximately $150-200k for kitchen, flooring, and master bath but we haven't had a proposal yet.  My current thoughts are a built-in fridge and plumbed-in water connection for an espresso machine.","answer":"I will add that almost everyone I\u2019ve know who ever remodeled a home came to the conclusion that it would have been preferable to buy a new place and renovate that to their liking before moving in. This might not apply if you have the square footage and love your location, but I am guessing with a price point lower than seven figures that\u2019s unlikely ;)"}
{"question":"I think real estate is the only thing you should invest in (if you can afford it), in India. Convince me otherwise. Coming from a traditional punjabi business family in Delhi, I've never invested in equities or anything else but real estate (both commercial and residential). I admit I don't know much about the equity market but whenever I have tried to dabble in it, it all seems futile in comparison.\n\nLet's say I have around 3 cr to invest. Why should I waste my time learning about the stock market or find out which funds provide the best returns when I can easily invest in one of the many affordable upcoming projects in Gurgaon that will for sure do well. At least in Gurgaon, there are tons and tons of new companies setting up shop, people from around the globe and from other places in India looking for places to rent. \n\nThe rents (commercial, but residential too recently) have been skyrocketing. Just to give you an example, I recently bought a small part of an office in Gurgaon for 2 cr where the rent is 80k a month and will also appreciate in value significantly, given the commercial development around it. Even if investing in a fund gives me a higher annual return than this, isn't a property like that a much safer and useful investment in the long run? \n\nWould really appreciate your opinions\/advice.","answer":"Talking purely on rent basis, for a 2crore property, a rent of 80000 is merely 4.8% return per annum and that too disregarding the maintenance a property demands. As far as capital gains are concerned, property has never been able to match equity in long term. Furthermore, there's lot more headache in selling and maintaining property as compared to funds\/equities.   Real estate market is not as liquid as equities or funds. As for me, I can't find a single reason to invest in property over equities. Convince me otherwise. :P"}
{"question":"Example of the importance of an emergency fund post-FIRE So, I FIRED about a year and half ago and own a duplex where I live in one unit and rent out the other.  Had to renovate the place when I first bought it but everything is pretty good with it now.  However, yesterday the AC went out so I got a repair crew in this morning to check it and yep, AC system is bust, it's 19 years old so was pretty much near the end of its lifecycle and repairing it would sort of just be slightly delaying the inevitable so I bought a replacement.  New system is going to cost around $8k (including extra filters and UV lighting to help its longevity and keep down the microbes), definitely not a fun expense, but it is a long term investment and I can't exactly skip it, especially in this summer.\n\nFortunately, I've been keeping over a years' worth of spending in cash in case of emergency, and so I was able to pay for it without having to go onto a payment plan (really don't want to be locked into a 10 year plan which is what they were pitching).  Now, the stock market is still really strong right now so it wouldn't exactly be a disaster to sell some stocks currently, but if the market was down, and I didn't have enough cash on hand, having to choose between selling undervalued stocks or locking myself into a long payment plan wouldn't really be a happy choice to make.\n\nSo yea, no regrets about having my emergency fund, even if it means missing out on a bit on some potential market gains.  It also helps a lot with peace of mind as I don't have to worry about how every little bounce of the market might affect me in the short term.","answer":"I wouldn't even classify an inevitable repair as an emergency - home repairs aren't perfectly predictable as to when they're going to happen, but it's absolutely predictable that they will happen, happen quite regularly, and as those big ticket items are ageing it's wise to be already planning and budgeting for their replacement. \n\nMaybe I just have a different definition of \"emergency\" but replacing a 19 year old AC unit seems quite a predictable expense to me (might last a few more years, might not, but you should already know you're on borrowed time)."}
{"question":"AITA: Selfish reason to not share FatFire? We all know about the risk of sharing FatFire and having friends\/family jealous or leeching off us. But for me, a bigger reason I don\u2019t share FatFire is because I like being ahead of my friends\/siblings\/coworkers\/neighbors, etc.  \n\nIt goes back to that old joke. How much is rich? Earning $1 more than your brother-in-law.  \n\nI\u2019m only like this because most of my friends and family are doing well, upper-middle class or higher. If a friend or family member was genuinely hurting I would try to help them as much as I could.  \n\nAnyone else not share FatFire for this darker reason?","answer":"I\u2019d say it\u2019s a grey area.

{"question":"Because of many years of reading this sub and the advice provided here, on the worst day of my life, I didn't lose my bitcoin. About 6 weeks ago, I had a house fire. It consumed everything. I did my best to fight it, and when I failed at that, woke my friend up who was staying in a guest room, then gave my all for about 15 minutes to find my cats in the blaze. Ultimately got dragged away by the FD and taken to the hospital. I didn't even think about my bitcoin, as honestly, my cats were all I cared about. \n\n3 weeks earlier, I realized I had a stupid amount of money sitting in a wallet.dat file on my computer, and that I really really should put it on a hardware wallet. So I did. I bought a trezor, loaded it up with my BTC and most other coins I had, and put it in a fire safe:\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/Z2eUs\n\nHere it is. Thanks Trezor. Your product is amazing. The house burned to the foundation, and the firesafe was externally destroyed, but despite the external appearance, inside was a toasted piece of paper with my seed words and this little guy. He was cooked from the heat, and sopping wet from the flood of water they poured on the house (nearest hydrant was a mile away and so it took an hour to start fighting it). \n\nOn that day I lost literally everything. Everything I have ever owned in 33 years of life, and my cats. Since that time I've been emotionally devastated, and I'm working really hard on recovering from that. But because of listening to advice on this sub, I had a trezor in a fire safe. I didn't lose anything but some byteball\/pivx\/dash I had on my desktop computer I forgot to backup. 95% of my holdings since 2012 remain. \n\nThank you \/r\/Bitcoin and thank you to the makers of Trezor. That little guy is tough as hell. I dont think its advertised as waterproof but I pulled it from an immersed box sopping wet. I let it dry and here is how it looked after when it worked. I now have two cloned trezors in different locations and a safety deposit box with my seed. Saving my bitcoin and this price rise has allowed us to pay for pretty much everything we need since the event happened. \n\nPlease, do not offer any donations to me, I'm fine. If you want to support anything, support the Ferndale Cat Shelter. I'm the president of the charity. We take care of Detroit Strays. My cats had Guinness World Records and did charity events to raise funds for them. Now that they are gone, we lost that revenue stream for the charity. We accept bitcoin locally at the catfe for donations, adoptions and coffee but I wont post that info here. \n\nYou'll know when you're there as our old address started with 1Catfe and our new address starts with 1CatCafe =) \n\nTook ages to offline hash that one out! \n\nAnyways, that's the story, thanks again \/r\/Bitcoin, you made the worst day of my life less terrible. \n\n\n**Edit: Fireproof safe was literally a 40 dollar walmart special. Would only recommend getting water and fire proof in the future as some medicine I had in there was destroyed due to getting wet**","answer":"Sorry about your misfortune and glad to hear there is a bright spot. I\u2019d like to add to your seed word comment. A lot of people believe a fireproof safe will protect their important papers. The safe might not burn and the contents might not burn, but heat is transferred to the contents. Depending on nature of contents, you can end up losing paperwork, cash, stock shares, passwords, etc. Gold can melt. Plastics will melt. \n\nSomething to keep in mind when you hide your seed words and other important papers.  "}
{"question":"Canada\u2019s top 1% not really fat? I\u2019ve seen a few Canadians here and I\u2019ve lived in Canada for a bit but haven\u2019t been able to yet commit to the idea of staying long term. Part of that consideration is that I haven\u2019t really been able to determine if there are opportunities to get big outcomes. I\u2019ve had a decent sized exit before moving here, have money to invest and what I\u2019d consider a slightly above average skillset. \n\nI recently came across statcan data, and it appears the threshold for being in the top 1% of income earners in Canada is 250K CAD: https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/t1\/tbl1\/en\/tv.action?pid=1110005501\n\nWith Canadian taxes, that doesn\u2019t seem like a whole lot of money and seems completely contrary to what Canadian housing prices would suggest? Is this just good tax planning?\n\nAre those that could actually RE fat while in Canada just a very small sub segment of the population?","answer":"325k individual and 400k HHI.\n\nAfter a 1.5M (post-tax) exit, we are on track to retire by 40-45. \n\nYes it\u2019s possible, but I think the bigger problem is lack of options on where to live depending on your preferences. If we want to live in the nicest neighborhoods close to a major city then we\u2019d need to keep working an extra 5-7 years and tie up 3-4M in our primary residence. In comparison, 2M can get you a gorgeous home close to several major cities in the US.\n\nBut if you\u2019re looking to retire somewhere rural and the winters don\u2019t bother you, things become much easier and cheaper. To be fair though, that applies to the US as well. \n\nShould also mentioned that if you are okay with public education and daycare, Canada can save you a substantial amount if you have 2+ kids. \n\nAlso, I just find that luxury items and services are overpriced for what you receive in Canada. For example:\n\n-\thome renovations and custom homes due to higher material and labor costs\n-\thousehold help (cleaners, personal chef, etc)\n-\tconcierge medical\n-\tfarm fresh produce and meats\n-\tprivate banking and access to investment capital\n-\t\u2026 could continue but need to run\n\nLastly, it seems access to reliable health care is no longer guaranteed in Canada and we cannot buy our way into better care here. Common advice is to get private health \/ life insurance that will cover out-of-country health care, but wtf. Why are we paying 53% of our income in taxes if the core systems are still broken."}
{"question":"Daily r\/thetagang Discussion Thread - What are your moves for today? Keep it friendly and civil; this is not WSB and automod will censor your posts at will for unsavory and unfriendly remarks. Try to keep shit posting and bragging to a minimum.","answer":"For the last two months I\u2019ve been running bull \/ bear plays against double or triple leveraged ETF\u2019s.  I like this play because the ETF\u2019s remove company risk (or at least greatly reduce it), and diversifying across ETF\u2019s reduces sector risk.  CSP\u2019s on both sides at .2-.3 delta, slightly skewed bull from a cash secured perspective because the market basically goes up long term.  It\u2019s been doing well but just kinda keeping up with or beating SPY a little.\n\nThis quarter (starting yesterday through the end of Q3) I am going full bull with ATM CSP\u2019s against my 8 usual suspects (AGQ, NUGT, SOXL, FAS, UPRO, TNA, UDOW, TQQQ), but this time not playing their bear counterparts at all.  After diversifying across these 8 ETF\u2019s my premium to make by 8\/20 stood at 7.5% of portfolio value as of yesterday (that\u2019s in just 52 days).  That\u2019s better than 1% per week.\n\nAs positions positively drift from ATM, I will BTC them and reopen at the nearest ATM strike to scalp as much appreciation as I can (twice per week: Friday\u2019s and Tuesday\u2019s as I don\u2019t have the time to make this my \u201cjob\u201d just yet).  If they are negative and stay negative by 21 days out, I will roll that exact same position out a month to preserve the delta to the next timetable to capture as much rebound as I can (when it inevitably happens).\n\nMy inspiration for this was a post that I read in here about a month or so ago, that I didn\u2019t have the balls to follow at the time (but the logic seemed sound).  The guy\u2019s (or gal\u2019s) main message was to not be afraid of near term losses.  Book your wins and stack them (by moving them to ATM as often as you can), and let the losers ride and roll them at the same position at 21 DTE if necessary.  I am up 8% so far in the last 3 months so at this point I am OK with trying this method out for the next quarter (again, I totally don\u2019t need this money any time soon so I am not recommending anyone to just blindly follow what I am doing).\n\nI\u2019ll check in once a week or so to let everyone know how it\u2019s going.

","answer":"The key thing for me here would be to work out what you really want to gain here.\n\nDo you...\n\nA) Want to start early to give yourself maximum exposure to market gains over a long period and give yourself the best chance of setting yourself up with a nice amount of money in your later life.\nB) Want to start early and play around and learn about the way the market works, and are prepared to lose much of or pretty much all of your money if that's the way the cookie crumbles, which it easily could.\n\nI would approach the two in very different ways. If A) I would highly recommend reading very seriously about index funds. The power of starting to pump any spare income into these at a young age is incredible, and at this stage could almost be considered mathematically proven to be the best way to use the market to look after your financial future.\n\nIf B), then I would start by reading The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, and looking up any terms you don't understand. It's likely there'll be a lot of it you can't really grasp (there still is for me) and you'll probably end up skipping some of it, but it will give you a good basis for understanding what sort of factors are at play.\n\nDoing both A) and B) is very possible, and is what most people end up doing to an extent. I do recommend keeping them separate though."}
{"question":"Dont be too greedy This doesn't apply to everyone. If eth recovers to 2.8k again and you feel like you wish to take profits, just do it. Dont ask the sub if it's a good idea because most are cultist and hypeboys. Now the hypeboys are gone quiet but when eth rises again, they'll hype it up and say dont sell etc. Truth is no one knows if the market will keep going up if it hits 2.8k again. This is clearly shown by the recent events. So, just take your profits. If it goes up, don't feel bad because there's always a reentry. If it goes down, congrats you took profits. Ofc, this only applies to those who wants to take profits.

{"question":"How can I finance or afford this Brooklyn multifamily? I need some advice. A distant family member inherited a 4,000 sqft 3-unit multifamily in Brooklyn NY years\/decades ago and I was just made aware of this. She has been thinking of selling. It's been mismanaged to put it lightly. Someone has offered her 1 million a few years ago but it is worth probably 2.5\/3mil. It is dated but still is a great property just needs updating in every unit. She was first strongly against the 1 mil but is now contemplating it.  Which blows my mind! \n\nI am very much into real estate investing if I had 1 million laying around I would pay cash without second-guessing. But with a smaller portfolio in an MCOL market, my portfolio is just over a million. But I am not in the position to buy this with a standard mortgage and DP of 20%. And I have no idea where to start in terms of getting creative with financing or how to approach this. I don't think she would give it away but I need some ideas on approaching this from a financing standpoint. It would take me about 1.5 years to afford the 20% downpayment if I went that route. Not sure she would want to wait that long. Any idea on financing options for this? I'd only be willing to sell one property in my portfolio but it would net about 60k. I am in the middle of renovations so it's not the ideal time financially for me in terms of how much savings I have available. Looking for real advice. It's an amazing opportunity so I don't want to pass.","answer":"I would offer her a land contract giving her a smaller Down payment a monthly note with a balloon maybe 5 year.

{"question":"Jerkin' it with Gherkinit Forward Looking TA for 8\/30\/21 - 9\/03\/21 I hope your all having a good weekend!\n\nI'm sick as hell right now so I'm gonna try to keep this short sweet and to the point this week.\n\nWe'll do a quick dive into the TA some theories I have on what is going on with GME right now and what I expect for the coming week and little overview of the market as a whole.\n\nAs always I will post a consolidated [Video DD of this on my YouTube](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/PickleFinancial) for those of you that don't have the time to read through this, or have visual impairments\/reading comprehension issues. This will be uploaded by...\n\n9 pm EDT\/UTC-4\n\n# Part I: Some Theory\n\nAfter closing out slightly above max pain on 2 consecutive Fridays it appears as if our quarterly run really kicked in on Tuesday with the price driving hard above $200 and closing out the week $25 dollars above max pain at $204.95 on Friday. If we compare this to our last run up it seems like a similar pattern is getting ready to play out. Wherein we run up hard Monday &amp; Tuesday with volume and volatility declining into the end of the week.\n\nThis is most likely an effect of :\n\n1. Not properly Delta Hedging the ITM calls from the previous week, Leaving a large amount of gamma exposure to be covered in T+2\n2. An attempt to reduce exposure and cover early in the week to avoid the cheap EOW gamma ramps that are being built by long funds.\n3. Also an attempt, at the end of the week, to profit the most off of max pain before the next cycle of covering begins.\n\nSo essentially let it run Monday\/Tuesday drive it down into the end of the week to minimize exposure for the following weeks covering.\n\nFor those of that want a reminder of the last time they did this here it is.\n\n[Previous Run on the 4h from June\\\/July](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8u68f1ppgck71.png?width=1564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb41442be52c746a49d0c6892adfee71461d9698)\n\nThis time they have less capital ( as is the nature of compounding losses). So, if we see their ability to bring the price down through the mid-week falter, GME is in a good position to see this take off.\n\nHere is our current run on the 4h timescale, with predicted action following the same trend.\n\n[Current run on the 4h](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wsuwxlxuock71.png?width=1591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d23a478843c83cb174d57010d223c04a88f6e04)\n\nAs we can see from this week the downward range on price is weaker which could mean tests at much higher levels on this run.\n\n**SPRT a distraction or a play by Long HFs?**\n\nI haven't had a lot of time to dive into it, the essence of my current working theory is that RenTech and possibly Vanguard are using SPRT to squeeze Susquehanna and Citadel. While Susquehanna and Citadel show net long positions on SPRT via their 13f's we know how \"reliable\" those can be and there are several factors that make SPRT a possible way to put pressure on the SHFs.\n\n1. Extremely low float of 15m shares almost 1\/3^(rd) of which is owned institutionally\n2. An ITM options chain that represents more than the available float\n3. Same institutional parties involved\n4. Extremely low ETF exposure which means it is unlikely to be in any of the meme stock derivative baskets (so not tied to GME via any options, swaps, etc..) hence there should be no correlation in price movement\n5. Massive Squeeze potential with very low capital deployment (cheap to squeeze for longs)\n6. Same long-term shorting visible on OBV as GME, this implies a heavy naked short position given the small size of the float.\n7. Timing, heavy movement on this stock began right as quarterly options rolled over at the beginning of the run on GME\n8. Reported Short Interest remains above 60%, Actually increasing after Fridays run to $59\n\n[SPRT Reported SI&amp;#37; of Float](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/a67okghkldk71.png?width=2473&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb6a1e77683616f9e342ba879bb708118b828891)\n\nI think if nothing else this theory deserves to be looked into, If Renaissance Technologies and Vanguard want to put pressure on Citadel and Susquehanna's margin requirements moving into these rule changes beginning in September this is basically the textbook perfect stock to do it with. Especially if their GME exposure is not currently affecting that margin due to swaps being used as collateral. I will try to dig into this more this week with some of the people on my discord currently it shows there **is** a statistical correlation between SPRT and GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Thanks to @ xKarl](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ihkj50rfldk71.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24e9fa3d59cfc2f18212235e8e59136815f49563)\n\n[Thanks to @ xKarl](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/n9a65serldk71.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=428e6186d903bf6c58a4b1303d1f1b6b35106e4b)\n\n\"If you can't fuck 'em in one hole, fuck 'em in another\"\n\n\\- *gherkinit 2021*\n\n**Gamma Exposure**\n\nThere seems to be some evidence coming to light that the ITM calls on GME are not being delta hedged properly meaning that MM's risk exposure on GameStop is becoming very dangerous. If this is the case gamma exposure on T+2 this week could be **orders of magnitude greater** than last Tuesday. While I don't currently have the gamma exposure data (only some circumstantial evidence) I did want to ask if anyone in the community has access to it if they can reach out to me please.\n\n# Part II: Technical Analysis\n\nThis was last weeks low\/high price prediction. That double bottom bounce played out much better this time...\n\n[Previous predicted trend](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yi7z40zwxck71.png?width=2447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=903832a351047a924a7f424e311c9f3e1f0b5a9e)\n\nI tried to adjust this throughout the week but really never nailed the consolidating volume. Honestly, my prediction last Sunday was more accurate than me trying to chase the volume throughout the week. I won't make that same mistake twice.\n\nSo let's look forward to what I expect for this week.\n\n[High\\\/Low Price predictions for this week](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kj1jt9948dk71.png?width=2455&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4e436f8e8bf280e8876408eb172e815a1d4f817)\n\nHere is the overlay of the predicted trend with the predicted price action\n\n[Trend\\\/Price Action Prediction Overlay for this week](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6du793hv9dk71.png?width=2093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94abe80cd49bf461bf908ae2dbe9337174295d99)\n\nIt appears the trend and Price predictions line up pretty well.\n\nLet look at some other indicators to affirm this trend\n\n**MACD**\n\nMACD is looking like several more days of uptrend are in store for us, as we still haven't reached the halfway point of the previous run.\n\n[MACD on the 1D](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/n06azhzjadk71.png?width=1590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9960c53fabc4f33d29a8ca38f21640dae9a9733a)\n\n**Stochastic RSI**\n\nStoch is continuing it's uptrend still 14 points shy of July's peak at 84 but this also looks promising for this coming week.\n\n[Stochastic RSI \\(14\\\/14\\\/21\\\/21\\) on the 1D](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/agqy2jx9bdk71.png?width=1589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e842c51a3fd9385af79275d6b93e9d9c3e3836d)\n\n**ADX \/ DMI +\/-**\n\nADX is starting to signal a very strong positive trend. This is generally a good indicator of the strength of the current trend and the +DMI value is showing it will continue to be positive.\n\nAnother note: the DMI is already exceeding the previous run up's value, meaning we may see way more potential upside this time around.\n\n[ADX DMI +\\\/- on the 1D](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5hg4lwplcdk71.png?width=1590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dda40668beab4280b6b339cc651323529570d51)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWith the currently wide bid ask spread it appears we are mimicking (possibly beating) the previous run up in June on about 25% of the previous volume. That means that if those levels of volume come in we could really see some upside potential, given that the price increases exponentially faster this time around.\n\nI have said in the past that we move from periods of low probability to periods of higher probability in regards to MOASS. This current period appears to be the highest chance of MOASS occurring since January.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nGME taking off at unprecedented speed and upward momentum. If there was a time for MOASS to occur we may be approaching it.\n\nBuckle up ?...\n\n# Part III: The Market, this fucker literally won't die...\n\nThe Fed announces plans to taper, record breaking storms rolling in, debt ceilings, delta variant cases shooting through the roof, inflation is higher than anticipated week over week, and RRP is consistently breaking new highs.\n\nYet, the market keeps chugging along, smashing through new all time highs and regaining it long-term trend. I suppose, the hope of the infrastructure bill and more possible stimulus coming in with new potential lockdowns is the bull case.\n\nEither way this thing could honestly fall off a cliff any day now. Here are the correction zones I will be looking for.\n\n[SPY on the 1D](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/edafj7lffdk71.png?width=1587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ed9a5cdc66f105d42594782bdcafb724fc75d11)\n\nHere is this weeks P\/E 10, It's got some room before reaching dot.com bubble levels but not much...\n\n[P\\\/E up .59 points since last week the largest single week gain since I began tracking it after the last correction.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7ead5xltfdk71.png?width=979&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df2e203692c546e688ede1f9ef828cbe8cc97b1a)\n\nStars burn brightest before they supernova...\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lzr69opigdk71.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=188cacdca68ffbe20932c5e69a01bb9e0366bf06\n\n# Part IV: Conclusion\n\nWith a market crash looking more likely everyday this could be a serious upcoming catalyst for MOASS. Additionally we see some pretty good evidence that not only are we running up again we are running up with a bid\/ask spread that creates the opportunity for large gap ups and violent upside potential. Any significant surge of buy pressure at this point could lead to massive price increases the constant gamma ramp setups can accelerate those increases and former resistances are already show next to no actual resistance.\n\nIs this it?\n\nI don't honestly know.\n\nBut, I can say with some confidence It looks like we are closer than we have ever been.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuy &amp; Hodl\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to see more information on this subject matter feel free to join me in the :\n\nIf you missed my [Discussion on the GameStop thesis with Tradespotting check it out here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kT-8XqqQcug)\n\nDaily Live charting (always under my profile [u\/gherkinit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/gherkinit\/)) from 8:45am - 4pm EDT on trading days\n\nJoin me, on my [YouTube Live Stream](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/PickleFinancial) from 9am - 4pm EDT on trading days\\*\n\nCheck out the [Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/BGmjnrvHnw) for more stuff with fellow apes\n\n**As always thanks for following along.**\n\n\ud83e\udd8d\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\\- Gherkinit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\n*\\* Although my profession is day trading, I in no way endorse day-trading of GME not only does it present significant risk, it can delay the squeeze.

{"question":"We are at or near The End of the Chinese Communist Government's ability to FUD Bitcoin Some elements within the Chinese government have opened major short positions on Bitcoin right before announcing major FUD. They have done this at least three times since 2013. I think this last one in May will be the last effective one. Not only because people are catching on to the scam, but also because they have now driven out most miners from the country and banned all transactions. This was perfectly timed with Elon's flip-flop. Elon was then immediately awarded by the Chinese government (where he had previously been struggling with red tape and bad press). The only arrow the Chinese Communist Party have left in their quiver is to ban possession, but that would be impossible to enforce, and would only make the CCP appear weak (the thing they fear the most) due to their inability to effectively enforce.

{"question":"ATTENTION INVESTORS IN CITADEL LLC!! Yes, the company you hold funds in is under investigation, potentially for racketeering. Millionaires and Billionaires this one's for you. You are fucked. Liquidating Citadel yourselves is the only option. Multi-millionaires and even billionaires who are invested with Citadel LLC, I am your god now. Heed what I say.\n\nMaybe you heard the news from your holographic personal news anchor, or your internal AI sent you a neural audiobook. You heard that Citadel was named in an active DOJ investigation. And just yesterday you heard the word \"Racketeering\" getting thrown around.\n\nI'm assuming you're clueless to what any of this about, similar to a retail investor who didn't follow GameStop for the last year. Pull your head out of the popcorn cuz I've got some knowledge for you.  The term investigation is new, within the last week. The DOJ claims they've been looking at this since early 2021.\n\nThe regular people here have been on it longer, and we didn't have the Patriot Act to tell us where to look for evidence, we just had publicly available information sources and that was enough to produce multiple great DD series' from multiple motivated authors.\n\nFrom publicly available information we've been aware of this entire time, racketeering comes as zero surprise.\n\nNow I'm assuming you haven't gone and read the DD because to read such rabble is beneath you, and even if you do watch financial news media you are missing a major part of the story there. Let me be the first to assure it is all true.\n\nThese hedge fucks hit a button and make free money for 10-20 years while a company assuredly goes bankrupt, then Citadel's market making arm naked shorts the bankrupted shares at $0.001 for an eternal and riskless grift. If they are being investigated, there is plenty of material there for Kenny and his brothers to be locked up.\n\nRetail is committed to GameStop stock which has a massive short position built up due to this 10-20 year exercise of naked shorting to force bankruptcy. Retail's commitment means the exposed shorts will have to be covered instead of relying on turnover rate to stem the impact of naked positions. This will happen, it is a certainty.\n\nWhen it does, Citadel will be liquidated. You know, the guys who restricted your withdrawals almost certainly after hearing they were under investigation. Yeah, that money they just said you couldn't have, it's all going to be gone. They were hoping it would either be gone or they would win (they can't win) before the investigation goes public. There's zero chance any of you stumbled through this sub or the other subs prior to knowing about an investigation, they were preparing themselves for the day you finally did.\n\nWhen they get liquidated by the banks, you lose everything. Citadel's obligation isn't to you anymore, it's to us. And I'm not letting any of you fucksticks jump me in line.\n\nI don't care if Citadel is the one to pay me, or if it's a bank, or if I have to get JPow himself to come hand draw me dollar bills once his printer busts. But you do care. You only get one shot. You ignored the signs for the past couple years and you built up precisely zero leverage, nice work smart guy.\n\nSo here's what you successful and smart people who got yourselves into this situation and blinded yourselves to any amount of true information should do now. Liquidate Citadel yourselves. Breach that contract. It's racketeering for fucks sake, you think they pursue that when they want to find evidence or when they want to make the damning shit that they have into a permanent example? Pull your money and create some of that leverage you never thought you'd need.\n\nLiquidate them. You multi-millionaire, you sexy little billionaire you. You big strong American citizen who worked so hard and was so smart to get yourself into this situation... Liquidate them. speed the process up I want to see banks popping, I'm sated on hedge funds going under.\n\nI really don't feel like putting a not legal or financial advice disclaimer in this because if any billionaire actually decides to act on this then he's way more retarded than me. Alas I was pretty heavy in some places so this isn't legal advice or financial advice. If you want that go ask Ken Griffin and see what those licenses are really worth.\n\nDo whatever the hell you want, just know that to an extent, we are looking out for you. Ape help Ape, and brother you may not be invested in GameStop but your financial decision making certainly makes you an ape.\n\nRedeemable ONLY to investors in Citadel who withdraw 100% of their funds: &gt;!Congrats, and Fuck You.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: Just want to remind the vocal minority that I flaired this under hype\/fluff, not DD, because it's supposed to be light.

Rolled it higher for a credit, now with 100% extrinsic.  Granted, I rolled it into an earnings week so that doesn't work out so beautifully all the time, but the decision was easy."}

{"question":"No more ICOs unless they have a fool-proof way to avoid what happened with Status today Even if congestion is clearing up now (only by a little), and even considering the massive amount of money Status brought in, today's SNT ICO was a complete failure. Status may have already killed their brand with the community before they even have a working product. Individuals who previously had no opinion of Status, or even had a positive opinion of Status, will now actively work to see it fail. My suggestion to Status was to refund all the ETH and try again in a few months or just take the money and run, because their entire project is DOA even if it works like magic when they get it into users' hands. They couldn't have screwed this up much more than they did.\n\nCivic actually has a decent solution to the problems faced by Status today: You basically must already be a confirmed user of Civic to be able to buy into the ICO. You must have sent your photo into their service and verified your identity. This ensures that Civic's ICO will go off orderly and cleanly.\n\nStatus could have done something similar. They whitelisted pools of slack insiders and allowed them to exceed the gas limit restriction placed on outsider investors. So the whitelisted groups were able to purchase their $millions of SNT immediately upon the opening bell, whereas folks who just wanted to invest a few ETH had to hammer the network for hours and throw plenty of gas down the tubes. Now, why in the hell would Status not simply do like Civic and limit participation only to members of such whitelisted pools? They could have organized more pools and made information on how to join them available in their videos and on their contribution page. The result would have been the same, but without the network apocalypse. If you didn't sign up for one of the pools then there would be no reason to even try to buy into the ICO, just like there's no reason to try to buy into Civic tomorrow unless you're already signed up.\n\nEthereum has a lot of public attention right now and policy makers are watching to see where it goes. Any more events like those of today will ensure that Ethereum is never anything more than a joke to the public at large, people who actually run away from new things at the mere mention of risk. Status' disaster of an ICO, even after being delayed by 3 days, just verified to policy makers that the developers and influencers in this market are not prepared or capable to be dealing with funds of this magnitude.\n\nIf you are a developer with plans for an ICO, put them on hold until these matters are resolved and trust is restored. If you are a developer that has a good idea to make ICOs run more smoothly, then you should drop what you're doing and build that program and run a smooth ICO of itself as proof of concept, selling that service to other companies who want to run an ICO through you, and you will end up with more money than Vitalik.\n\nTo the Ethereum investor community: it is time to stand up and say enough is enough, that we will boycott all ICOs that do not have a clear, proven plan that eliminates the risk of turning into a Status-level disaster. Civic, I've already mentioned, looks solid. Any team that doesn't have a plan on the level of Civic should be laughed right out of the market no matter how promising their tech looks.\n\nStatus absolutely destroyed their brand over the course of a few hours and made Ethereum look awful right when the spotlight was on it. ETH is already crashing down to $330 as investors start to realize that this crypto and its top minds aren't yet ready for the big leagues. The negative reporting on Status tomorrow will probably drive ETH down to $250 or lower as new buyers panic sell and cash out before the next disaster strikes. Status is almost single-handedly responsible for this and ought to face the full fury of this community and the market. We simply cannot allow this to happen again.","answer":"Dude Status has 15k unique token holders, and people are buying it right now with no issue. It's raised $95.6 million right now. Yes the transactions got smothered and the had some big whales that got exemptions to the gas limit, but their purchases did not count against our caps.\n\nI think all of this is being way overblown.\n\nEdit: Also I heard there was a big mining block that was intentionally dropping transactions so that theirs would go through, which contributed to the chaos. I'll grab a link in a bit when I'm not feeling lazy, but it was mentioned in \/r\/statusim today. "}

Anyone have experience with this and how to get around it?","answer":"disclaimer: im the furthest thing from a money expert, i just saw this on \/r\/all.\n\nsome banks will let you schedule automatic transfers, like \"on the 1st of every month, transfer $X from account A to account B.\" like some people might deposit their payroll into a checking, and automatically put back $X into their savings, or deposit their payroll into saving and pull $X into their checking as an \"allowance\" for themselves, or theyll use this feature to make any regular payment, for example alimony or child support or something. account B doesnt even have to be your account. you can probably set all this up through online banking for some banks.\n\nso maybe you could setup a new normal account that payroll is fine with, and then setup a regular automatic transfer from that into your high yield account. end result is its just direct deposit with extra steps and a delay of 2-3 days or something. its kind of stupid to have to jump through these hoops, but it should mostly be automatic, you probably just want to glance at it online when things are supposed to go through to make sure there is no hiccups. maybe put some extra in the new account to avoid an overdraft if DD is late for some reason, like holidays. \n\nagain, im not a money expert, maybe someone has a better solution."}
{"question":"Why are Australian Mortgage Rates Variable and not Fixed? While you can get fixed for short-term (1-7 years) mortgage products in Australia are always variable over the 30 year period. Why?\n\nFrom a financial solvency perspective it makes very little sense. While you can approve an applicant for a mortgage with rates at 3%, they may be far less solvent if rates were to rise to 7% in 15 years time.\n\nIt seems from a regulator's perspective, and even an investor's perspective, these products are far riskier than the alternative.\n\nWhy do Australian banks not offer fixed 15\/20\/30 year mortgages like their American counterparts?","answer":"&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Why don\u2019t Australian lenders offer 30-year fixed terms?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The one fundamental reason that Australians don\u2019t have access to 30-year fixed-rate mortgages is because of the lack of a well-developed secondary mortgage market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the US lenders know they can offer 30-year fixed terms without holding the debt on their balance sheets for 30 years. Instead, they can immediately sell the loan to Fannie Mae or its partner organisation, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will then bundle the loan with other mortgages as a security, and sell it to investors.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While Australian banks do raise funds through the bundling and reselling of mortgages, known as securitisation, there is no government enterprise in Australia that fulfils the function of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, guaranteeing that it will purchase loans that meet certain credit criteria. The vast majority of home loans in the US are securitised and sold on the secondary market, while a 2014 study by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA ) said only 15% of Australian home loans are securitised.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Because banks in Australia generally hold home loans on their balance sheets rather than on-selling them, there\u2019s less willingness to offer long fixed rate terms.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For this reason, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see 30-year fixed rates in Australia any time soon. But with so many Australians opting to take their chances on variable rates, most borrowers may not be too fussed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source](https:\/\/www.finder.com.au\/why-doesnt-australia-have-30-year-fixed-rate-home-loans)"}
{"question":"FIRE in Germany Crazy cross post from the German finance subreddit, translated to English:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Finanzen\/comments\/y44832\/entsparphase_f%C3%BCr_fire_in_deutschland\/\n\n\n&gt; Hi, I'm currently planning my savings strategy for the time after FIRE and wanted to ask for suggestions on how I can optimise my situation. It will definitely be at least 3-5 years before that happens. But I would like to set the course. I plan to stop working when I'm about 40. I've been working towards that since my early 20s, living very frugally and trying to educate myself in this area.\n\n&gt; **Overview**\n\n&gt; About me, I am 35, work in IT and have private health insurance. I have only paid a total of \u20ac1,900 into the pension fund and have accumulated less than 5 years of contributions. I have a holding company to which I have lent 340k (current account) and receive interest at 0.5% p.a.. The holding company owns 50% of an operating limited company where I work with a friend as an IT consultant. Furthermore, the holding company has another subsidiary in which a few properties have been lost. So far, I have a multi-family house and a flat there (still being paid off, the rents pay for loans and maintenance). I am the managing director of the three companies. Furthermore, I privately own a flat near a large German city that is already paid off. I manage a total of 5 tenants (3 in the house and 1 in each flat). I myself live with my girlfriend for rent.\n\n&gt; The holding company has a portfolio with Interactive Brokers. Currently the net liquidation value is about 630k. The portfolio currently generates about 20k in dividends. I write covered calls against my positions and sell spreads or iron condors on the SPX quite frequently. This also generates about 10k\/year. The options strategy is more volatile and is cut back a lot in the desaving phase.\n\n&gt; The condominium in the private assets generates about 10k\/year.\n\n&gt; The real estate in the Immo GmbH generates a return of about 18k\/year, but there are still payments to the bank. The cash flow from here is something for later (20+ years).\n\n&gt; If there is a need, I can go into more detail on the individual positions. However, this is primarily about optimised ways of paying money to me as a private person with as little tax and social security contributions as possible.\n\n&gt; **Health insurance**\n\n&gt; For health insurance for pensioners (KVdR), I have to join the GKV until about 40-42 (90% of the 2nd half of my working life). There is the option of voluntary or compulsory insurance. I consider it better to be compulsorily insured [1], as capital and rental income are not included in the income subject to compulsory contributions for calculating the SHI contribution.\n\n&gt; My favourite choice is the midijob. I plan to earn \u20ac1 above the mini-job limit. That would currently be 521\u20ac. This means that I have to pay \u20ac0.30 in private contributions and the employer pays \u20ac147.04. For 147.34\u20ac, there is then contribution time for the pension and 68.01\u20ac\/month into the pension fund, as well as compulsory insurance in the GKV. This gets me out of PKV and my GKV time pays into the compulsory time for KVdR.\n\n&gt; This leads to annual income of 6,252\u20ac (12*521\u20ac). These are subject to income tax and social security (which is intentional). The employer's contribution is 1,764.48\u20ac (12\\*147.04\u20ac). I plan to give up my managing director position in the operational GmbH and take a midijob in the same company. My business partner agrees to this. I get procuration and can continue to help with the administration. The costs for the midijob (6,252\u20ac+1,764.48\u20ac = 8,016.48\u20ac) are charged by the operative GmbH to my holding company. Thus, these are operating expenses in the holding company.\n\n&gt; **Income exempt from social security**\n\n&gt; In order to fill the free time I have, among other things, thought about giving IT courses and\/or financial planning courses at schools. I have acquaintances and business friends who also want to pursue social\/charitable goals. For this purpose we are planning to found a non-profit association. For my non-profit work in the association, I will receive an exercise leader allowance of 3,000\u20ac\/year and a voluntary work allowance of 840\u20ac\/year. My holding company will donate the money to the association. Because the association is a non-profit organisation, a profit-reducing donation receipt can be issued. The donations are business expenses. In the case of me as a private individual, the income is exempt from income tax and social security contributions.\n\n&gt; **Current account interest**\n\n&gt; My holding company owes me 340k as mentioned at the beginning. Interest must be paid on this debt. I would prefer to have it without interest, but this is not possible without disadvantages. I get about 1,740\u20ac in interest per year. This is free of social security contributions but subject to income tax. Capital gains tax does not apply here either, as the interest payments come from my 100%-owned holding company.\n\n&gt; **Rental income**\n\n&gt; My paid-off flat generates 10,000\u20ac\/year in rental income. The money is social security-free but subject to income tax.\n\n&gt; **Interim summary**\n\n&gt; The income so far amounts to 6,252\u20ac (midijob), 3,000\u20ac (lump sum for exercise leaders), 840\u20ac (lump sum for voluntary work), 1,740\u20ac (interest income), 10,000\u20ac (rental income). Midijob, interest and rental income (6,252\u20ac+1,740\u20ac+10,000\u20ac=17,992\u20ac) are subject to income tax. Except for the rental income, the money comes indirectly from the holding company and reduces profits there.\n\n&gt; **Other income exempt from social security and income tax**\n\n&gt; **Private deposit**\n\n&gt; I have chosen the positions and size of my private custody account in such a way that I get the saver's allowance of \u20ac801 out of it. If this amount is increased, I adjust my positions so that I can use the higher saver's lump sum. For now, I'm assuming \u20ac801.\n\n&gt; **Loan repayment**\n\n&gt; As mentioned above, the holding company still owes me 340k. If I repay 11k of this annually, that will last me for about 30 years. If I started immediately, I would then be 65 years old. Just in time that I would be in the KVdR.\n\n&gt; **Vouchers**\n\n&gt; As mentioned at the beginning, I am the managing director of my holding company and my Immo GmbH. I will then become a midi-jobber in the operating GmbH. So I will have 3 permanent jobs. Each employee can receive 50\u20ac in vouchers per month. That is 350\u20ac\/month for me. So 150\u20ac12=1.800\u20ac\/year. Currently, I already draw the vouchers and do our weekly shopping with them.\n\n&gt; **Crypto profits**\n\n&gt; Privately I stake Ethereum with Rocketpool [3]. I only have a mini-pool so far. The second one is currently being saved. The mechanics of Rocketpool allow me to control when I pay out the tokens with the Rocketpool tokens. As a private person, the inflow principle applies to me. Here, I can comply very precisely with the exemption limit of \u20ac600 according to \u00a7 23 EStG [4]. In other words, I plan to sell Rocketpool tokens and Ether worth \u20ac600 per year.\n\n&gt; **Balance sheet**\n\n&gt; The income tax-free income amounts to:\n\n&gt; 3,000\u20ac (exercise leader flat rate)\n\n&gt; 840\u20ac (honorary lump sum)\n\n&gt; 801\u20ac (saver's lump sum)\n\n&gt; 11.000\u20ac (loan repayment)\n\n&gt; 1.800\u20ac (vouchers)\n\n&gt; 600\u20ac (crypto profits)\n\n&gt; This makes a total of 18,041\u20ac.\n\n&gt; The income subject to income tax amounts to \u20ac17,992 - as described above. This triggers a social security contribution burden of \u20ac1,764.48.\n\n&gt; The income subject to income tax of 17,992\u20ac exceeds 10,347\u20ac. From this sum, income tax is due in 2022. Income tax must be paid on 17,992\u20ac-10,347\u20ac = 7,645\u20ac. This would amount to \u20ac1,623.64 in income tax in 2022. The income tax can be reduced by offsetting the costs for the association's work and the privately owned property, as well as travel costs for the midijob. Possibly also property visits in holiday resorts, for which lump sums for distance and meals can be deducted. Tips on how to further reduce income tax would be welcome.\n\n&gt; In the end, that makes \u20ac34,408.35 net per year, or \u20ac2,867.36 per month, with a total tax burden of 13.27% at the limited liability company and private level.\n\n&gt; I could already pull the ripcord and stop or very much reduce my operational work. However, based on the figures, that would still be too risky for me and I would like to see my portfolio in the 7-digit range and also have enough on the side to be able to redeem the remaining properties after the fixed interest period (8 years approx.), if the loan conditions appear unfavourable. That will be about 270k. The more I have in my war chest, the more likely it is that I will be able to support my girlfriend with it.\n\n&gt; Do you have any suggestions or ideas for other income tax-free ways of drawing money out of the holding company? What do you think of the plan? Have I made a big mistake somewhere? I am aware that the case law can still change. I take the whole thing more as a rough plan. The association has to be set up. The second Rocketpool still has to be saved and set up.\n\n&gt; [1] https:\/\/www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de\/beitraege.html\n\n&gt; [2] https:\/\/www.ihre-vorsorge.de\/rechner\/midijob-rechner.html\n\n&gt; [3] https:\/\/rocketpool.net\/\n\n&gt; [4] https:\/\/www.gesetze-im-internet.de\/estg\/__23.html\n\n&gt; [5] https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSo5l9f8vknwSQBbp23Tvx-49-oi_M5chb_HgWQDFdLNYLrQvPsmpSB3Q5ZweBfvzSEa9H0G7qFRfZt\/pubhtml?gid=650430727&amp;single=true\n\nTranslated with DeepL free version https:\/\/www.deepl.com\/translator","answer":"I wonder if these actions are perfectly legal or would be considered tax evasion if examined by the German IRS equivalent.

{"question":"Why is GME mostly trading sideways? I have no wrinkles in my brain but I thought about this today. As the Market Makers are providing infinite liquidity, we are buying more and more GME. We don't care too much about the price. Maybe some people are setting lower limit buys to get more shares for their hard-earned dollars and that would explain the price dropping a bit here and there... but that's not what I'm getting at.\n\nSo, I started to wonder. Are we mostly somehow controlling the price of GME by buying it at whatever the MMs are selling it to us for? Sure, most of us are DRSing but I'm sure there's still a decent about of 'soon-to-be Gmericans' still purchasing shares through their broker.\n\nThe MMs want to crash the price but we just keep on buying it at any price, so the price just is currently what it is.\n\nHere's perhaps a shit example but imagine you have a candy fairy and he (Doug let's call him) tells you the candy is $1 each. You're like, fuck yeah that's a good price, I'll buy 10. Then he's like oh now it's $0.5 each and you're like, that's fucking awesome, I can buy double the amount. Then he's like look at me go, I'm infinite liquidity, have more at $0.25 and you're like, you're fucking weird, but ok let's get 4 times the amount. At a certain point, you ask yourself... Does this fairy ever run out of candy? Well, in this dumb ass example, he doesn't, so he doesn't give a fuck what the price is, he's always making money off of you. But, let's say a fucking CANDYMASTER comes around and says there's only a finite amount of candy available and that candy fairy owes me for all that candy he sold to you. You bet that candy fairy would be trying to buy all the candy from you for pennies on the dollar because of how badly he fucked up. And you bet the price would squeeze. I don't know, I'm five years old.\n\nNow moving on, the beauty of price discovery is when we have officially locked the float through DRS. That's when MMs and Brokers will start to look around with that 'uhhh oh shit' look in their eyes as they realize the shares are all locked and they need to deliver the shares their 'clients' are supposed to be holding in their accounts.\n\nSo until we lock the float, GME will just trade at whatever we buy it at.\n\nAs we approach locking the float completely, I think that's when small players will be rushing to get their shares before they get blown up.\n\nTLDR: I believe that as MMs provide infinite liquidity and some APES are still buying through Brokers, the price of GME will be whatever we buy it at until the inevitable moment where the entire float is locked and MMs\/Brokers need to somehow bid for the real shares on the lit markets.

{"question":"A couple months ago I was on the brink of homelessness. Link to my original post will be in comments.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few months, and I took a lot of your guys\u2019 advice. I quit what I was doing for work, and am now making $18\/hr back in an industry I love. I\u2019ve got most of my back dates utilities taken care of. In 2 weeks I will get my first paycheck from my new job. It will be around $1,150 after tax. I am caught up on my rent and back to paying month by month, and my initial goal is to set myself up a $1,000 dollar savings fund so I can continue to try to pay bills on time as the need arises. My current financial situation looks like this.\n\nRent: $700\/mo\n\nCar Payment: $186\/mo\n\nAuto Repair Loan: $122\/mo (4 payments until paid up)\n\nCC Debt: $50\/mo\n\nGroceries: $200\/mo\n\nGas\/Vehicle Maintenance: $290\n\nAll of the utilities, now that we are caught back up, are being paid by my partner. According to my math, my total obligations add up to just over one total check worth of income. My job also entitles me to monthly bonuses based off of the companies overall net profit. This should give me an estimated 200-400 extra per month. This brings my total monthly income to $2,275 after tax but before the bonus. Based on this information, what can I be doing now to help set myself up financially down the line, my goal is to buy a house within the next 3 years. If I save 50% of my remaining income every month, I should have roughly 18k by the end of that 3 year mark. Does this existing plan sound too aggressive or too easy?

{"question":"What would a world of $15,000 ETH look like? Reddit co\\-founder, Alexis Ohanian recently made the [bold claim](https:\/\/www.ccn.com\/ethereum-price-will-reach-15000-this-year-reddit-co-founder\/) that ETH will hit a price of $15,000 by year end \\(\\~ $1.5 Trillion market cap\\).\n\n&gt;I still hold a little bit of Bitcoin, and I think it has such mindshare that it will continue to be a store of value. I\u2019m most bullish about Ethereum simply because people are actually building on it,\u201d he said, predicting later that \u201c At the end of the year, Bitcoin will be at $20,000. And Ethereum will be at $15,000\n\nWhile throwing out trillion dollar estimates is the norm among crypto\\-bulls, most believe that's a 5, 10, or 20 year journey.

So what would it take for ETH to hit $15,000?\n\nMy valuation estimates are based on the following premise \\(see [my valuation model](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/7qqb6y\/hype_has_far_exceeded_reality\/) for more detail\\):\n\n&gt;Ethereum market cap is worth approximately $100 billion for every $1 billion of real Dapp network transactions per day\n\nWith that as the starting point, here are some reference points:\n\n1. **Daily usage on the scale of VISA** \\- Real transactions \\(not just day\\-trading activity\\) would need to hit about $15 Billion per day.  That's about 10x the scale of PayPal and a approaching Visa's \\~ $24B daily volume.\n2. **Accepted by all major retailers** \\- To even come close to the scale of Visa, we'd see major adoption across retail platforms \\- Amazon, Walmart, ebay. You'd also need to see mass adoption from brick and mortar retail and a secure means of payment \\(ETH cards or mobile apps like Apple Pay\\).\n3. **Mainstream financial instruments and trading markets** \\- It takes a LOT of trading to support price discovery of an asset that big. By comparison, oil trading is 20\\-30x bigger than actual oil consumption. So $15 Billion of real Dapp transactions would indicate $300\\-500 billion in trading volume. To facilitate that much trading, we'd need mass adoption of ETH financial instruments like futures contracts and ETFs.\n4. **More wallets than humans on earth** \\- Currently, 60&amp;#37; of the world has at least one bank account \\(\\~4.6B people\\). Many of those have multiple accounts, averaging 2.0\\-2.5 or so among developed nations. We'd likely need to see comparable consumer adoption of ETH and ETH wallet usage. Adding in corporate, non\\-personal and burner wallets pushes the number even higher. So lets round it out to an even 10B or so wallets needed to sustain an ETH economy.\n5. **You're doing your Chrismas shopping in ETH** \\- If ETH is going to reach the scale of Visa, we'd have to use it as often as Visa \\(duh\\). That means you're going to be buying a good portion of Christmas gifts with ETH.\n\nThat's a snapshot of what a sustainable $15,000\/ETH economy should look like.

[This article](https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2021\/01\/29\/investing\/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk\/index.html) doesn't have sources, but it points out how global GME went. There's many more articles like it, for plenty of countries. Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. \"China\u2019s approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth\u201481 percent said they trade at least once a month\" [From this article](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2015\/07\/09\/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html)\n\n*Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today's price.* **Retail has no control my ass**. Lets take a look at this:\n\nA graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8\/6\/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Robintrack.net](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)\n\nThe above shows on 8\/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8\/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. &amp; if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|5|730k shares|\n|1|10|1.46m shares|\n|5|5|3.65m shares|\n|5|10|7.3m shares|\n|10|5|7.3m shares|\n|10|10|14.6m shares|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.\n\n\"The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12\/31\/2020)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: https:\\\/\\\/www.nasdaq.com\\\/articles\\\/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ludljsdtn1n61.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cd3e4113641f443d002de2dde95913532440a47)\n\nIt appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*\n\nSo why does retail \"not control the market\" ?\n\nPersonally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.\n\n1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1\/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own\/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.\n2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for \"power\" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.\n\nI know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.\n\nEdit: \/u\/alice_oe made this data point \u201cI use the European broker eToro, they have 20 million users and their app currently shows that 9.49% of them holds GME. In January this number was around 15%.\u201d \nHeavily supports my points made, felt like it\u2019s important.","answer":"Thank you so much for this post.  Very well done. \n It's clear that a hearts and minds campaign is being fought to keep retail from realizing the collective power we have.  \nWhy?\n \n Why try to convince retail they are powerless when the statistics prove that's false? \n \n   This is the definition of a misinformation campaign.  If I can make you believe that collectively you have no power in the market. \n Then individually you will squander that power."}

{"question":"Parents want to sell the house to repay half of the mortgage and buy a new one. We already have another house that has no mortgages etc. I tell them we should move there instead. They don't understand me. What can I do? I'm from a middle class family. For the past 8 years weve been living in a nice suburban area on a house with a mortgage. Both parents are above 65 and only one gets pension. They want to sell the house which I agree we don't need as we have another one that is further off around 35miles from city center.\n\nThe thing is that they want to sell it to get a smaller one in this area and repay half the mortgage (to get smaller payment installments). The reason they wanna do this is because my sisters which are in their mid 20s don't wanna leave this area where they have all their friends. From my parents side they want to leave us a nice suburban house when they go their merry way.\n\nThe thing is that I feel this is a bad move as we will inherit the mortgage when they pass. Isn't it better to sell the house and invest the rest on other things?

That said, if it doesn't really eat up a lot of my capital, I would surely aim towards balancing out the return targets with the re-buy. \n\nThe stock price falling by X% is a good way to bring down your average buying price but only when you're certain that the stock will reach your target levels wihtin your target time range. On the other hand, you can even re-buy at a higher level than your previous purchase if you're willing to increase your returns.(Provided you are confident in your analysis)\n\nI haven't used Nifty\/Sensex as indicators to buy a stock, but maybe someone else might enlighten us with that question."}

{"question":"Success does not happen overnight - to those of you who hopped in with lambos in your eyes and dreams of 1000% gains overnight, I'm sorry to disappoint you, this fight is likely to go on for weeks. There has been an influx of misinformation on all online forums. On WeBull, I see commenters seeing short squeezes going on EVERYWHERE - including stocks with under 20% short interest. We have here an influx of retail investors. Many of them have never had a penny in the stock market before. Many of them don't understand the situation beyond what the price reflects at the moment and think that every dip is a short ladder...what's worse, many of them are vulnerable to emotional trades, having put in more than they can afford to lose but without the conditioning many traders develop after years of seeing the ups and downs.\n\nNot everything is a short squeeze.\n\nNot everything is a conspiracy theory (although the recent $SLV situation given Citadel's positions is very suspect - infer what you will)\n\nThere is no set date for the squeeze - There is NO set date for shorts to have to cover unless market conditions force them to.\n\nThe only way to win this, is to hold. Turn your share lending off if your broker allows. Ride the ups and the downs. Set you limit sell much higher than the market value - this will influence the price.\n\nMost importantly, understand: a true short squeeze will happen if shorts are FORCED to cover their positions at whatever the current price is. This is not the same as contract expiry - they are two different things.\n\nShort sellers have likely been covering as much as they can on every dip, to cover themselves. This is because shares are still being traded.\n\nDon't sell. We need to limit the supply.

{"question":"SPY Swing Trading **Personal Info:** So, I've been trading spy for about almost a year right now. Super successful trading this. At first I was just buying the dip with long dated options (1 month or so). However, Now I have refined my strategy that has turned my account parabolic. \n\nThis little pull back we've seen the last couple of days is really really attractive. Swung some poooots today for a easy 2x on my account today. Sold out. (way too early could have X10) and now im looking for a bottoming pattern. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PART ONE: \"Swinging SPY\" and \"Buying the DIP\" \n\nRight now, I think we can see two levels act as **support.** \n\n# The 50 Day EMA\n\n* For the last year the 50 EMA (daily) has offered a decent amount of support and really hasn't fallen under that. \n\n[\\(the Straight line is community trend line\\) and the 50ema is the little green swiggly line.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wouqmxdxdrm71.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863635298a1c83c740c79cb1081babd170a7a041)\n\n# The RSI levels\n\n* I really hate RSI for selling levels. But I think if you see patterns for RSI its a great buy indicator. \n* We are in a good buy signal area.\n* Every time it reaches below 30 on the RSI (2Hour) we can see a big price action movement.\n\n[RSI is at 30 rn](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/uewmxoo8erm71.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7c082e244470ab79fd041d78fc7e4424a2261bb)\n\n# My Personal Strategy for this pattern:\n\n* Scale into positions\n   * This is very important. Normally I split my entire account into about 3 sections. \n      * This is when I buy into a options for SPY. Typically I scale into a 1 week expiring call where my break even is roughly about 1.25% up from current levels.\n      * Next level is when I hit the 50Ema I buy calls where my break even is roughly 1% up expring 2 days out.\n      * If it keeps falling then I save the last 3rd of my account for longer dated calls when this bottoms and can see clear trend reversal (this hasn't happened yet)\n      * If it doesn't keep falling normally, if I see a bullish pattern breaking out above the 20EMA I'll yolo this into 1 week expiring calls pretty close to the money.\n* Weird Risk Management\n   * IF YOU DO NOT SECTION YOU ACCOUNT THEN YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING\n      * say you are wrong on the first support level and you yolo your account you lose everything.\n      * But, with sectioning out your account into 3 different trades. then it will normally \n* Big **kahunas** **and Patience**\n   * Gotta have big balls\n   * Have to be patient\n\nHonestly, I should be selling a freaking course for $200 on this stuff and stealing peoples moneys. Like honestly this strategy isn't for everyone. But, It is such an easy way to make phenomenal gains these last couple of months.   \n\n\n# Stipulations: \n\n* The market could just fall more than 10% and this pattern of bullish \"dip buying\" just gets stoppped. (This is why \"Section 3\" of my account is there)\n* Patterns don't always follow through\n* Sometimes the patterns are confusing and high stress. For example, this march was a weird time to be trading this. \n\nHere is the March (Daily) chart on SPY, this was my biggest spy profit so far. Like, made me wanna drop out of college moment.\n\nFirst we will start with RED: Here is where I yolo'd my section one of my account (1\/3 of account). Took 75% of section one and sold it as a signicant amount of profit. Spy then proceeded to turn around and smack the 50 Ema Line. My entry was impectable right on the 50ema and yolo'd \"section\" one and \"section two\" of my account into 3DTE options. I gained signifcant profit. However, That highlighted section. That day my account took a -50%, But still overall profit from the first trade from the previous march one. I also entered pooooots at the highlighted section once it failed to break above 20EMA. (super easy trade). THennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn The next highlighted section). Hollllly crap. I entered my 50Ema position (1\/3 of my account) then I subsquently lost it all with that long wick to the downside the next day. However When I saw it bounce of that level very aggressively. I split my account into 1\/3 into cash, 1\/3 into 0DTE calls and then 2DTE calls. This by far is one of my most successful trades. \n\n[March $SPY](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1hm9bcyejrm71.png?width=332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=025e55aa65e84d2602daeb404ed2fa93328032d6)\n\nThis long winded toot of my own horn isnt to well toot my horn. It is to show that this stragey needs to be carefully monitored for me and it doesn't need to change that much. Also that scaling into positions, Risk REWARD is very very good for trading options. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PART TWO: Day Trading SPY (Opening Gap Fill)\n\nThis is by far my favorite pattern to trade. This is normally what I look for every day on SPY. Not all the days it holds up. But i'd say about 90% of the time SPY fills the gap it creates from the opening market.  \n\n\nFor this I normally trade about 25-50% of my account into 0DTE calls\/puts or 1DTE calls\/poots. I always sell at when the Gap gets filled. Always sell when I take a 50% \n\nHere is a bunch of charts from these last two weeks from SPY. The highlighted sections were the gaps created from market close and market open. (All charts are on the 5 minute). The blue line is my positions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Todays POOT Swing](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4jwq80e2mrm71.png?width=291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62f7423bb007c5030232421dbc1269e68e72d2d0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Example 2](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ik0x6668mrm71.png?width=352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bef81e070caf501a75f5fa1121938d7abe604176)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Example 3 \\(This one happened very very fast. and gave up all gains. However, You can see later in the day it also filled. ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nruxorjamrm71.png?width=546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a6dfd30c2f594366460e344277c973c5a264f7d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This one took much longer and lots of Theta Decay. However ended positive eventually](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/achafx1fmrm71.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cb1dff167c6b5bd69b840509bab513ddfa6cbec)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Example 4](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cu79rszomrm71.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e68a7625f3981997e9e0468f25464740f839448)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Example 5](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/b9af6xcqmrm71.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed233a05a9b22b3b8c0d226d7ecfe2f70468bf8e)\n\nTypically smaller moves on 0DTE SPY options will net you about 20% gain. However, when the gap is larger .33%-.5% then you can look at doubling your account right there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion: \n\nHere is everything I pretty much do on SPY. Spy is a perfect stock to trade. It often gets a really bad wrap for \"gambling\" and being \"unpredictable\". However, If you look for patterns and have proper risk management then it is really easy to be consistant. Normally. I look for gap fills every morning and these are pretty decent gains over time. However, The big money is in those OTM calls when you hit close to the 50EMA line.","answer":"About three weeks ago, I started swing trading SPY and QQQ in my paper money account to see if it\u2019s a viable way to consistently grow my account.

When you place a market order, you\u2019re looking to get your order filled immediately\n    - **[Marketable Limit Orders:](https:\/\/ibkr.info\/node\/194)** Marketable orders are either market, buy, or sell limit orders whose limit price is at, above, or below the current market price, respectively. **Marketable orders remove liquidity from the market.** In theory, these orders are instantly executable as there is a buyer\/seller who\u2019s willing to make a trade at the current trading price.\n    - **Non-marketable orders:** Non-marketable orders are buy and sell limit orders in which the limit price is below and above the current market price, respectively. **Non-marketable orders add liquidity to the market.**\n- Citadel, Virtu, UBS and G1 Execution dominate the majority of LPL\u2019s order flow for all the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500, Non-S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 and Option trades.\n- LPL\u2019s **S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 Non-directed order flow data**\n    - Citadel was the #1 venue for every month except for June (#2 broker)\n    - Citadel averaged **33%** for all their non-directed S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 trades!\n- LPL\u2019s **Non-S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 trade order flow data**\n    - G1 Execution and Citadel were #1 and #2 for every month of this year \n    - Citadel averaged **44%**  of all their non-directed Non-S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 trades!\n- LPL\u2019s **Option trade order flow data**\n    - Citadel and Susquehanna are the only two brokers trading LPL\u2019s options\n    - Citadel averaged **83%** of all their non-directed Options trades!\n\n# LPL\u2019s order flow through Citadel visualized for all order types\n\n- [S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 order flow](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Fpvd3tI) \n- [Non S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 order flow](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Gi5Wt8E)\n- [Options order flow](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ramkFGx)\n- What I find most fascinating is the gap between MARKETABLE and NON-MARKETABLE limit orders during January!\n- For January and February, 75% and 65% of LPL\u2019s Non-S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 marketable limit orders were by Citadel.\n- While we don\u2019t know the volume, we can infer that relative to the other venues, Citadel was the main bottle neck for these perfectly executable orders. I wonder if Citadel removing the buy button on robbin da hood had anything thing to do with this\u2026\n\n# **TLDR** \n\n- The people hiring people to shill on reddit are SHFs. One of these folks, Doug Yauger, works for Sovereign Wealth Advisors who routes all their orders through and LPL Financial LLC. LPL Financial\u2019s SEC 606 Rule Report discloses only a few hedge funds manage their entire order flows for stocks and options. Among these is Citadel, which accounts on average 33%, 44% and 83% of all their S&amp;amp;amp;P 500, Non-S&amp;amp;amp;P 500, and Options trade order flows. So, **SHF r fuk.**\n- Of note, during the month of January, the marketable limit orders (i.e. trades that could be immediately traded) were grotesquely high at 75% and 65% for January and February for Non-S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 stocks. This may suggest market manipulation by slowing trades and\/or re-directing trades to different exchanges (potentially dark pools). This needs to be confirmed however.\n\nBuy, Hodl, DRS!\n\nEdit #1 - Formatting. \n\nEdit #2 - [u\/LogicalFaith](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/pvsbyp\/shfs_hiring_shills_on_reddit_are_in_bed_with_lpl\/hed5ssa\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;amp;amp;context=3) highlights that the focus should be on LPLs order flow through Citadel and not one individual brokerage representative.

{"question":"How to start talking about money? I am a student and I just started doing my internships in several law firms in Western Europe.

To be honest, having lived in France for several years, I found people here rarely talk about money either. Any advice on how people talk (in a better and constructive way) about money?\nThanks!","answer":"You should be straight forward about money, only if you're situation is not \"okay\".\n If you're internship is just about learning, you shouldn't be caring about financial stakes. On the other hand if you are doing qualified work that makes the company \"earn\", then you should be asking for fair payement. Just follow your instincts, as they will see what's right or wrong.\n\nAnd for manners, money is always going to be a sensitive subject for everything, but you have to be able to discuss it if you want to get anywhere. It's not because it's sensitive that it should not be discussed.\n\nInternships here in Belgium are often not compensated, but as soon as the work done is considered as \"qualified\" the internship isn't really an internship anymore. That's how a good employer would see things. Most money talk really comes down to the value you're actually providing. Could you be replaced tommorow, easily? Or would you be a great factor to growth of the company?\n\nAlso if they are not respecting the contracts you first signed, you should obviously be discussing it as fast as possible. When you do talk about those things be fast &amp; clear about what's on your mind, and if he doesnt comply you should put it in a written document next and eventually if that doesn't work either, quit or lawyer up. \n\nYou can private message me, and we can further discuss the issue.

Most stocks I have been buying primarily on my Roth IRA while I have been using Robinhood for those that I plan on using options (Wheels Strategy) to earn additional passive income. I have mostly been investing in companies with a long term horizon using primarily a free cash flow valuation but I have also been investing in undervalued companies suing financial ratios such as EV\/EBIT, Magic Formula, low PEG stocks, and great balance sheet strength. \n\nMy biggest holdings are:\n\nAlibaba (BABA) average price is about $130 making up about 10 - 12% of my overall portfolio. I having been buying lately but if it goes down sub $100 I might mostly likely start accumulating more. \n\nMeta (META) average price is about $200 and makes up about 7.50% of my overall portfolio. I have been actively buying this stock especially anything sub $200. \n\nTencent (TCEHY) average cost is about $52.50 and makes up about 6.50% of my portfolio. I have been buying this stock. \n\nStocks I have been buying recently:\n\nWBD (Biggest stock I am buying) - tremendous streaming and cable content. Spinoff and possible turnaround opportunity. \n\nFLWS (simple business selling various gifts, candy, and merchandise. Not much debt and growing revenues. Growth stock potential. \n\nSTNE (Brazilian fin-tech facilitating digital transactions with socio-economic tailwinds favoring digitization of transactions. Has negative current earnings but has experienced explosive revenues and its earnings in the past has stabalized and gone in the green. I need to read more on this stock but Sven Carlin analyzed this stock this year.\n\nStellantis (STLA) - the combination of Fiat and Chrysler. They are a cyclical play so expect lower price during a recession but they have a huge margin of safety. They are currently selling for $12.30 with cash per share at $17.66, book value at $20 and negative net debt. They have an EV\/EBITDA of 0.97 and are offering an 8% dividend yield. \n\nParamount (PARA) - Similar reasons as WBD but I am not buying as aggressively. I am mostly buying this stock in my Robinhood account to use the Wheels Options Strategy. PARAP (the preferred shares) are convertible. They are offering 14% yield. \n\nOESX (micro-cap industrial stock) with very low valuations, little to no debt, trading at 1x book value. They provide a lot of LED services to major clients and other lighting work. \n\nSWKS provides 5g capabilities by offering radio frequency devices to major players particularly Apple which allows for wireless communication. They seem to be in a good industry. \n\nFl - Perhaps one of the best retail rebound stocks that pays a good  6% dividend. \n\nPayPAL - Decent valuations and a known company. Much cheaper than some of their more hyped up counterparts I.E Stripe, Affirm, et al. \n\nINTC - It's problems are already priced for a discount. \n\nMU - just starting to add a position. It is basically an oligopoly. \n\nZIM - One of the biggest shipping companies in the world with strong tailwinds and industry consolidation. Morningstar estimates it might be about 35% undervalued and is offering a 25% dividend yield. \n\nVALE - A major Brazilian oil ore producer which is an industry that seems to be relatively undervalued with good dividends (BHP, Rio Tinto.) From a valuation perspective I would go with VALE which morningstar also believes it to be 30% undervalued and is offering a 15% dividend (special dividend I believe). \n\nSPG - One of the most undervalued REITS with a bit of turnaround potential.

I'm concerned about their strategy. From what I understand (haven't researched it in a while) they are using all their FCF to build fabs. Meanwhile semiconductor manufacturing is in my view a naturally monopolistic industry with mediocre margins. There is a reason TSMC has crushed the competition. This is a world where all bleeding edge tech will flock to you even if you have only a 5% - 10% advantage. \n\nWhat doesn't get talked about is that AMD followed a similar strategy with Global Foundries and it almost bankrupted them (they were even bankrolled by Abu Dhabi) sure intel has alot of money but they are pursuing this strategy from a position of weakness. AMD is crushing them in design, tsmc is crushing them in process technology. They are behind in EUV machines (made worse by the scarce supply) Intel doesn't even have the design tools for partners to use their Fab. Their gonna bleed the company dry trying to build these fabs and worse they are selling off amazing IP like mobile eye to do it. Personally I'll take mobile eye over a multi-Billion dollar fab. These new fabs will burn cash if they cant fill it and at the very least will be a massive depreciation drag for years to come. For fun go look at Global Foundries Income statement I sure hope for intels sake the strategy doesnt turn out like that. Oh and in a decade or so the fab will probably be outdated and they'll need to retool it\/build a new one. It just doesn't seem worth the opportunity cost for me tbh.

{"question":"Closing the deal on FIRE I am sitting in the Beijing airport waiting on a flight to Tokyo. It's been delayed, so I thought I would check in with my favorite FI community. \n\nI really admire those of you that can track every dime you earned or spent for the last 15 years. Some of you talk about 3.x percent as your SWR. Close examination of fine details is not my personality, nor how I live my life. I am more of a big picture person, and I am comfortable with unknowns.  Before I FIRE'd, I tracked expenses and net worth and aimed for na 4% SWR.  But my calculus was back of the napkin compared to you all that have years of spreadsheets.\n\nSo what got me to close on retiring from my career (9 years of training, 18 years in practice)? Pulling the trigger and retiring is not easy. It is always going to be a leap of faith. I think folks here convince themselves that there is little or no risk by having the bullet proof safe withdrawal rate, but there is always risk.  \n\nFor me, I had zero ambivalence about quitting my career.  It was 100% the right thing for me - I was going to die younger if I kept sitting in a chair and I am very passionate about living my best life. My SO and I were on the same page about the plan we had together. Finally, I got comfortable with my loosey-goosey back of the napkin FIRE math by building a side hustle and demonstrating to myself that part-time, I could earn as much as I would ever need in a worse case scenario. \n\nNow I am FIRE'd for the last 18 &amp; 1\/2 months. I just got a 1099 from PayPal indicating that last year I grossed ~$50k in my part time side hustle (about 40k net). I am taking a month away to explore Japan - one of the few bucket items I have had since my early 20's. \n\nI am really glad I retired and did not let the uncertainty of that decision force me into additional years of career work. I love putting in the time trying to live my best life, instead of selling my time to a job. I hope this doesn't come off braggy, I don't mean it to. Rather, I just want to let others that are like me know that you can FIRE imperfectly and still be OK. You may have to build in tolerances like a side hustle or geographic arbitrage or something else that makes the math work. Best regards.","answer":"I'd say you're doing well - still retiring much earlier than most who are not able to retire and continue to work longer.    \n\n\nWhat's the $50k part time hustle?  I'd say if you expect that to remain consistent with that plus some savings you should be fine.    \n\n\nEnjoy Japan!"}

The report was released a day earlier than usual due to the July Fourth U.S. holiday.\n\nThe numbers capture the move by all 50 states to get activity moving again after the virus seized up much of the U.S., particularly service-related industries.\n\nHowever, because the government survey comes from the middle of the month, it does not account for the suspension or rollbacks in regions hit by a resurgence in coronavirus cases.\n\nThe unemployment rate also likely is understated due to counting errors at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Workers who still have jobs but have not been working are being counted as employed and even though as supposed to be considered unemployed under BLS rules.","answer":"So the asterisk at the bottom is basically the same one as last time, where unemployed people are being counted as employed because it is supposedly temporary?\n\nWe are also ignoring the fact that the states have locked down again.\n\nMarkets are going to moon regardless"}
{"question":"What would happen if Satoshi Nakamoto's wallet became active? With several stories in the past weeks of Satoshi era bitcoin wallets showing signs of activity after years of lying dormant, I began to ponder what would happen if Satoshi's wallet were to become active? \n\n\nFrom what I understand, this wallet which contains over 1 million bitcoin, is one of the largest, if not the largest, holders of bitcoin. So much so that if it were to show any signs of movement on the blockchain it would crash the bitcoin value altogether because it is assumed that these coins are burned and forever untouchable.  \n\n\nI don't know if that is a fact or just something that I read here in passing, but with so many dormant wallets becoming active again I was wondering what effects some of these satoshi era and silk road era whales would have on the market?","answer":"Hal Finney is dead, so his wallets probably aren't moving unless he set it up in his will somehow for them to trigger at some point.\n\nTo answer your question, the market would absolutely shit its pants. There's not enough liquidity in any book anywhere to absorb that kind of sell. Would be a huge dump at first, then if he didn't move any to exchange it would recover. If they started moving to Binance or Coinbase or something bitcoin would probably instadump to sub 20k. If he started aggressively selling... that would be really bad. Probably dump to like 3k. The people in this sub don't have a fucking clue what they're talking about, sellers of less than 1 billion worth of bitcoin have sent the market down 25% before."}
{"question":"GNT Price Surge? I bought a handful back at .03$ and now looking at buying a bucket full based on market cap, visibility and latest surge...is that a gamble or am I being logical and strategic? ","answer":"I have a similar question that I think is worth discussing along the same lines: what, assuming this is really a groundbreaking big deal, is an actual possible market cap to expect GNT to reach as a ceiling?\n\n\nAt $1 per GNT you're looking at an $820mio market cap, just under 20% of Ethereum's current market cap. Do we really think that Golem as a single Dapp is that disruptive and has that much value relative to Ethereum?\n\n\nI have no idea how to realistically evaluate this but, imo, 20% seems high based on the stage the Golem Project and Ethereum are at now. As ethereum's value goes up obviously the market cap relative to Ethereum would go down at a $1 per GNT price point.\nMy point being that if GNT does reach $1 per token I cannot imagine Ethereum will still be near this current market cap.\n\n\nCurrently the above points are what are holding me back from putting more money into GNT as it stands. I do think there may be more room to grow for GNT in the short term (~1.7% of the market cap of Eth currently), but I don't know what that growth looks like or how valuable this Dapp."}
{"question":"Bad experience with IndusInd Bank. Don't trust them with Thrid Party Investments. Background story:\n\nMy wife had some money in the savings account. Her account manager from IndusInd Bank asked for a meeting to explain a new investment option. The person explained that it was a Tax Free investment for a 15 year period like PPF and would give a return of 9% which is higher than PPF. It seemed all good, they took her signature on a KYC form and cancelled cheque. I asked them about the plan details and they said they will share the next day. In my absence, they asked my wife to get an online verification as per procedure. The numbers weren't discussed at all. \n\n\nAfter 15 days, we received the policy of Tata AIA details, I was a bit surprised since the policy was initiated with no discussion on the numbers. When I saw the policy details, the returns were 4.5%. I immediately connected with the IndusInd guys to explain this and I wanted all the calculations on mail. I got a half baked calculation sheet which clearly was showing 4.5% return. Now the policy had seven years of investment and cancellation had heavy penalty. I told them, it's not acceptable and you need to cancel this without any penalty. But they didn't have the authority to do it and it would also mean accepting their mistake. \n\n\nAction taken: I contacted Tata AIA directly mentioning that this was a misrepresentation of facts. Thankfully they were willing to accommodate. In next two weeks I had interactions with Tata and IndusInd, their representative came over personally along with IndusInd. The IndusInd employees were unable to explain the numbers and after 3 weeks Tata AIA approved the cancellation with full refund. IndusInd employees or senior management were not at all responsive or helpful in this case. \n\n\nLearnings: Don't make investments through banks, they have preferred vendors and they will oversell to get more commissions. They don't care if you lose or make money. \n\nThis is my second such problem with IndusInd so I will advice everyone to stay away from them if possible. Their policy is to just make more money out of customers. \n\n\nTLDR\nDon't trust banks in my case IndusInd for third party investments. Specially warn the people around you who don't understand the calculations. Its better to make investments through good brokers whose fees are linked to your returns. That way they also work hard to get more returns.","answer":"This isn't anything new, such mis-selling happens all the time all over country.\n\nKudos to you for taking action and getting it cancelled outright. Lot of us wait it out and write it off as a loss.\n\nOne point to note: all life insurance \/ ULIP policies have a free look period, where you can cancel the plan after just subscribing to those, without any penalty.

{"question":"Why do families not share details of financial assets and policies with family?? My neighbour's husband recently passed away unexpectedly. I witnessed how his demise opened the floodgates of troubles in their life, particularly for his wife. It broke my heart.\n\nHis wife has been a traditional homemaker. Aunty has always been a joyful and giving woman but her entire life came to a standstill after his death. Their daughter was supposed to start college this year, but this misfortunate circumstance has changed their life. Both of them were completely clueless about their household finances and financial liabilities.\n\n**It hit me hard when I realised that there is no way under any law to find out information regarding a deceased person's assets, policies, properties, investments and funds even by their successors unless they are already equipped with this information. It's a scavenger hunt after that.**\n\nShe asked me for help since I work in consulting. I was disheartened when I came to know she has never visited a bank and had no clue about any of his current or savings accounts, policies, or investments. He never shared any relevant details with her. She confided that he was a loving and dutiful husband. Their marriage was traditional where her responsibility was to manage the family and he was to manage the finance and outside responsibilities. While he sometimes discussed but never shared any exact details.\n\nNow she feels completely handicapped. Between handling crematory responsibilities, and dealing with guests to day-to-day expenses she exhausted all the funds she had with her. She had no clue about any documentation and paperwork. Witnessing their struggle to access their own claims and funds,  facing financial responsibilities while dealing with the loss &amp; trauma has been exhausting, even for me.\n\n**I too had never shared the actual details about my bank accounts &amp; investments with my parents.** In our family, while we discuss finances very openly, my father still hasn't shared all details.\n\nIt is crucial to discuss and share household and personal finances with family, in detail. It is alarmingly essential to be open and inclusive about your finances with your loved ones.\n\n**Most women in India who are between their 40-60's were married to men older than them. They were not allowed opportunities or the privileges to be financially independent. They were conditioned to not involve themselves in matters of business and finance. Women also tend to live longer than men. These women will be faced with similar circumstances in the last years of their lives unless they are actively equipped.**\n\nFurther, in India, parents also seldom share their true financial circumstances and decisions with their children and vice-versa. I realised that in a society where survival means protecting self-interests from very early on, the head of the family or anyone in any position of power is so deeply engaged in managing responsibilities &amp; safeguarding their interests that they rarely trust others with it.\n\nSudden death in the family can lead to a complete breakdown of stability for the family.\n\nIt is truly sad that in a lifetime, we aren't being able to say the most important things to the people that matter the most.\n\nI wonder how truly big this problem is.\n\n**Do you\/your parents have open conversations about your finances with your family?

{"question":"Investing in Multifamily Properties Under 100k Respectable people,\n\nI own one home, but I'm thinking of getting involved in duplexes\/triplexes\/etc in cities where there is an abundance of these properties under 100k. Now, I looked on Realtor and Trulia and I see several plexes in the US midwest, in mid-sized cities with at least 1 pro sports team, that are under 100k and that seem to generate great month to month revenue. ($750 per unit per month on average) \n\nMy question before I get invested in a property like this is:\n\n**What's the catch?** Why are these properties even on the market for more than a few days given the positive cashflow potential? I found a duplex in a decent overal shape that costs 65k and that generates $1500 per month. A no-brainer on paper? What am I missing here?\n\nThanks guys","answer":"The very first answer is that they're probably isn't cash flow for most of them. I invest in the same price point, and you would be surprised the junk that gets on the market. you wonder how they will ever sell. After doing YOUR OWN RENT RESEARCH in the area, taking 40% or so to hold back, mortgage if you're using one, a lot of these homes don't perform. In this market it's also very likely that a lot of these houses will need a lot of repairs. This will put off getting renters in there and also cost you to do the work."}
{"question":"The amount of posts shitting on BBBY are telling me one thing, we at least need to dig deeper there's something here. It's no secret that this sub would be obviously infiltrated by bots or people trying to spread certain FUD. Now I love GME more than my family, but I have to say I think dismissing the possibility of basket swaps and how this ties into GME especially with Ryan Cohen referencing it so goddamn much. Isn't it a little stupid to not at least dig a bit? I'm not saying lock the float or buy it, research first. I don't care what the SEC says, we research here apes. In the meantime DRS HODL (none of this is financial advice.)\n\n\nEdit: see what I mean? Massive downvotes and negative sentiment. Most being that this is a GME sub. So let me spell it out for you guys. Ryan Cohen = GME chairman. Chairman tweets get posted here. Chairman tweets BBBY multiple times. Also bought loads of BBBY. But we're not supposed to look into it or talk about it? At least admit the huge pushback with BBBY is fucking sus. Reminds me back when DRS was downvoted and hated on for a while. Not saying anything is here, just let's look and be sure because Wrinkles are needed here.\n\n\nEdit 2: I want to urge anyone reading this again to please look at this post and read the comments. Something is not right. I know it sounds crazy but this isn't normal and is inorganic. I don't ever remember a simple discussion being so \"divisive\" especially when RC is heavily involved with it. At least not in a long time or since DRS was backlashed. I've been commenting vigorously to show their arguments against a little more digging are shallow at best. Stay vigilant \/ stand your ground \/ think for yourself. DRS HODL. I'm with you. I just want to go to Uranus and our DD isn't done. Last I checked I'm not a millionaire and we haven't won yet. To think we have all the pieces to this puzzle is honestly asinine.","answer":"Ask why did RC buy what 60-80 calls for Jan 2023 if I remember correctly?

{"question":"Have $570k (1900+ shares) of MSFT. Pls advice on good Covered call strategy for additional monthly income **Additional context &amp; compilation based on some of the questions asked and for ease of comprehending the amazing responses in this thread:** Have accumulated these over time as never sold those rewards\/bonuses when emp. Yes higher than desired concentration in single stock but still overall portfolio is diversified with ETFs, MFs and oh, did I mention healthy % allocated to few d*egen strategy* as well (r\/HFEA and versions of it, Crypto etc). My cost basis is around $150 so definitely don't want to get called away given tax implications. But comfortable with 0.1 - 0.3 delta and it appears 30-45 DTE seems preferred duration although I have to read up more on few great suggestions on weeklies, 0.35 delta. Last year, I used to follow the .1 delta 30 DTE strategy but with the up only market conditions it didn\u2019t work out well where after several 'roll up and out', was staring at $70K current value hit on the upside gains. However this year I switched to more active management with 0.3 delta, 2-3 months out for healthy premium, sell on big green days, buy back at 20% profit and wait to sell more until next big green candle. I pretty much recovered all my 'losses' from last year and now back in black in this strategy which I track very closely in a spreadsheet. This active management this year has been super profitable but of course the IV has been super high with Powell\/Putin contributing to good bit of vol. So I still see my approach thus far and luck as function of current market conditions and not tenable. Hence reaching out to experts here on what CC strategy with such sizable locked shares (hodl for long term) folks have employed with lessons learnt \/ pro-tips \/ 'rolling playbook' etc.\n\n**Update**: THANK YOU ALL for so many pro-tips and certainly lots of experienced hands here. Over past 15+ months, I have gone through multiple scenarios and always struggled on the optimal 'roll decisions' during expiration time. And learnt great bit (hard way) to develop my *amateur system* which I see has good bit of validation from experts in this thread yet lots of great learnings to further improvise my system. And also hoping folks in my shoes can pick up couple of nuggets from this rich thread on covered call strategy","answer":"Well this is gonna be fun....\n\nSince you don't want to lose your shares, I suggest selling and rolling the (at most) 0.35 delta Call strikes on a weekly basis. The trick is that you want to sell only 33% of the contracts available to you at first, so if you have 1900 shares, sell and roll only 6. This should get you around $1080 per week. When you roll, you will attempt to keep at the 0.35 delta range, if you were itm and you can't do it without coming out of pocket, then increase the number of contracts until you are flat....but if you can roll for credit, reduce until you are back to 33% of available. If you are reaching maximum contracts, attempt to skip a week or up to 4 weeks as far up as you can with as little amount of contracts as you can so that nothing comes out of pocket.\n\n1. If the stock has an ex-div date the next day, always make sure you are at least $1.20 otm by half an hour before market closes (the higher the better, your choice)...if not, roll to the following week early as described above for rolling procedures\n2. If you set a price alert at your strike price, you can roll early up and out for credit usually without having to increase contract size....keep ahead of the game as much as possible. If you roll early, try to go as far up as you can, you shouldn't worry about the credits, this is a corrective action as you gained value on the stock rising.\n3. If you previously rolled early and stock falls, you can attempt to move the contracts closer in time and down to burn it quicker (try not to go past 0.35 delta). If it's a previously early roll, it is 7DTE, AND you have 33% contract size, you can roll it down to the 0.35 delta to collect any lost premium to adjustments.\n\nThe money you collect on premium can be used to:\n\n1. Buy more shares directly to increase your portfolio\n2. Buy \"forwards\" as I have described many times in these forums (it is a calendar spread to load value and protect against runs). If you build up enough of these, then you could effectively just roll these instead and leave stock completely alone.\n3. Keep it to the side to help pay to move any positions out instead of increasing contract sizes, giving you more of a \"buffer\" (if you buy shares as #1 suggests, you can actually sell them back to do the same effect, so combining this with #1)\n4. Build up enough cash to purchase a 600+DTE Put contract to protect the portfolio, it will cost quite a bit upfront, but at 365 DTE, you roll it to another 600+DTE for a minimal carry price. Should be about 4k to set up, but then it's only 1k per year after that per contract.\n5. Take your wife or husband out for a nice meal.\n\nIf you didn't care about losing the shares, I would say go with 100% 0.35 delta rolls buying forwards with the premium until you are at double rolling....then reduce the longs with premiums until they're loaded up with high value (0.80+ delta), collapse them at the end of the year and let the whole thing cool off for 31 days to clear any wash sales, maybe buy some Christmas presents, start up again middle of January. If you get called, repurchase and resell Calls otherwise."}
{"question":"Chasing assignment How many here implement a strategy that purposefully chases assignment? I\u2019ve been running the wheel for a long while and have made steady returns. This may be as low as 2%\/month or as high as 14%\/month if I end up assigned on CSPs prior to a turn-around in the underlying. The seemingly obvious takeaway is if you can augment your monthly % return from sold premium with an additional % return from an appreciation in the underlying then you accelerate compounding returns. \n\nSo what I want to try is this (it\u2019s simple, I know): select a stock from my narrow list of those I already own (or would like to own) that is at a technical\/fundamental turnaround and is clearly already within an uptrending channel on the hourly\/daily chart. Buy said stock and immediately sell CCs either ATM or just one strike out. This would preferably be weeklies because the goal is to quickly chase assignment during the uptrending channel, augmenting the extrinsic value that remains near the money with a % return on the underlying. Weekly CCs would help to not only capture that upward momentum but to decrease turnaround time. \n\nMy goal has changed from trying to maximize returns from the wheel obtained during the usual 4-6 weeks to repeating smaller gains more rapidly. I\u2019d rather make 2-3% weekly as opposed to 5-6% every month. \n\nObviously the risk is misidentifying an uptrend and the underlying turns against you. In which case you either take the L or roll down and out, like usual. In the former since you\u2019re only selling weeklies the percent loss shouldn\u2019t be as bad as the usual 4-6 week wheel, since there\u2019s less total time for the underlying to depreciate. And like I mentioned, you should only be selling into an existing strong uptrend anyway. \n\nJust talking out loud and would like to get community thoughts, anecdotal if possible. Obviously I know \u201cit works until it doesn\u2019t.\u201d","answer":"Sometimes I do this, but I essentially sell CSPs using calls. \n\nLet\u2019s say I want to write a CSP at 20 Delta and that would normally give me 2% ROI for the week. Note what the strike is. \nThen, go buy 100 shares of the stock, then write a ITM call at the same strike. \n\nIdeally, the stock won\u2019t tank and your call will get exercised. The premium you initially received should be significantly more than the loss occured at exercising. Keep in mind, your true profit is locked in when you write the call. \n\nIf the stock tanks and your call does not get exercised, is just as if your CSP got exercised. You own the shares, pocket the premium, and wheel it."}

{"question":"Anyone chosen to invest in shares instead of purchasing a PPOR? Apologies for another post about housing. \n\nI\u2019m keen to hear from people that have chosen to invest in the sharemarket instead of taking the plunge into home ownership. \n\nI\u2019m at a point where I have a fairly decent deposit saved, but locking myself in to 30 odd years of debt isn\u2019t filling me with thoughts of happiness. For those that have decided to rent and invest, what\u2019s your plan and how did you reach your decision?","answer":"Not yet at the stage where I've had to lock in to one path, but here are a few things that make me intend to pursue renting long term:\n\n- Want to be flexible enough to move every few years (e.g. relocating for jobs, adjusting to charging circumstances etc)\n- The capital requirements to own and maintain a home are quite significant, meaning that (unless you're very wealthy), a PPOR is a significant concentration of your capital. This is fine if you plan to live in a place your whole life, but more of a concern if you plan to move and need to maintain equity\n- Maintaining a non housing centric portfolio is an opportunity to be more invested in productive assets. This is mostly psychological for now, but could apply if ideas come up that you genuinely believe in and want to back financially.\n- I think Australia overvalues PPOR and that it has led to a damaging situation where the middle class is subsidised through housing programs and the poor get screwed through poor rental rights. Whilst this is a collective effect, I don't feel happy tacitly supporting this.\n\nThere are however some issues that I foresee that would tip the scales into me ending up buying:\n\n- Kids\n- Place I'm living having incredibly poor rental rights\n- Wife wanting to settle down and build roots in a particular community\n- Building my own home. This isn't a huge ambition for me, but maybe later in life I could see this happening and is kinda incompatible with renting.\n\nIn terms of plan, financially is relatively simple: it's actually easier to maintain a portfolio when you don't have to worry about the impact of PPOR. You just invest more money. \nI think the bigger issue is lifestyle: owning will generally work better with being part of a localised community. Renting will potentially allow you to access a broader net, which can include more specialised groups but may restrict building deep 20+ year bonds with your neighbours."}

{"question":"Car totaled, and I used the money to pay off $13,500 in debt. I've had credit card debt for way too long. Two cards, one at about $3,300 and another around $4,600. And I took out a $10K loan for a 4Runner a few years back that I probably shouldn't have. Long story short, the car was pummled by hail in the spring, and totaled out. The insurance company called it a complete loss and cut me a check for $13,500 (which I thought was overvalued, but aparently they're worth way more in Colorado than in Illinois). \n\nI used the money to pay off the rest that I owed on the car ($5,600), and my two credit cards. I've been riding my bicycle since they took the car away, and am feeling physically and mentally great. The check just cleared and I wiped out all three debts within five minutes. I feel so liberated. Now I just have to put all that money towards my student loans, and anticipate being debt free within three years.\n\nI do want to say that subscribing to this forum kept my mind in the game regarding a debt free life. I've been chipping away at these debts, but this windfall was amazing and I feel like I just took the cheat tunnel in Mario to skip a few levels.

One of the best was that I could have sold the car before the hail damage and walked away with the same deal. That\u2019s true, and I think the real lesson here is that paying off old debts is more important than owning a nice car *if you don\u2019t need said car.*","answer":"I got really lucky with a car about six years ago.\n\nI purchased an 07' Accord for $12,000 with 60k miles.

The car was valued at about $11,000 at the time and insurance valued the hail damage at about $10,800, right below total loss value.

The hail damage was right below the cars value, which is why I received a check and got to keep the car.

{"question":"Could the VRBO, AirBNB, Homeaway, etc... phenomenon be creating a new real estate bubble? It seems like lots of ordinary people I know are buying properties and leasing them short term as vacation rentals, becoming their own mini-hotel entrepreneurs. Not only this, but our conversations in social settings often focus on how lucrative this endeavor is. Here in Arizona, people are bragging about how they can pay for a year's worth of their mortgage in a few weeks by leasing their property primarily to midwesterners during MLB spring training. I would imagine this is also happening in many places around the country where Vacations are common (CA, FL, TX, etc...)\n\nI recall that one indication of a bubble occurs when ordinary people begin boasting about financial windfalls in areas they are not experts in (day trading tech stocks in the 90's, flipping houses in the 00's, and now running vacation rentals). The stripper in \"The Big Short\" who owns 5 condos comes to mind as an example. Or stories about a secretary at the globe.com who became a mulit-millionaire after the company's IPO. \n\nCould this vacation rental phenomenon be a bubble?

If millions of Americans are sitting on vacant vacation rentals and the economy turns south could many of them go belly up?","answer":"I do this for a living, and manage STR's for clients in my area alongside my own units. I'm also an agent, and REI for 11 years, and basically have been a part of all aspects of real estate from commercial development to remodeling single family homes in my life.\n\nI think the main bubble is from equities investors treating real estate as a liquid asset such as stocks and bonds. They all pool their money into a fund, then that fund buys up a parcel or decrepit building, in a good market, at a vastly inflated price (at the height of the market), and then it is rehabbed or developed into Class A rentals (lower profits than Class C), and managed to milk out the most money possible from these properties by inflating rents. \n\nRight now, cities, like [Dallas-Ft.

{"question":"Is negative equity on a car loan EVER worth it? **See bottom for updates on the situation**\nEDIT: I realized how confusing it was for everyone that I listed all prices in Canadian currency. I went through my post and edited all of them to USD. If you see people talking about a $69k loan, that\u2019s referring to $49k USD, as now written below.\n\nHey! My fianc\u00e9 and I purchased a 2019 Kia Sorento in May 2019 from a Kia dealership. It was our first car purchase. We did end up having some buyer\u2019s remorse for the following reasons (I\u2019m Canadian but I converted all prices to USD):\n\n1. $231 biweekly, 84-month financing at 7.99% - High interest rate, long term loan made me nervous and payments were a wee bit above budget (by a wee bit, I mean more like a lot). \n\nOriginally, we wanted to get a cheaper used car (budget: &amp;lt;$20,000) but the $8,000 cash-back offered by the dealer was a pretty attractive option at the time. That cash back was only available on the purchase of a brand new, more expensive car. The Sorento was valued at ~27k. We paid off most of our credit card debt with that cash back.\n\nSo I was making breakfast two days ago when I got a random phone call. I answered, and it was the Kia dealership that sold us our car 10 months prior. They were letting us know about low interest rate promotions they have going on. \u201cYou could qualify for a 0.99% interest rate if you\u2019re interested in trading-in your car!\u201d I was skeptical but kept an open mind. Going from 7.99% to 0.99% is a big jump worth looking into, in my opinion. I let them check our eligibility for this rate and yes, we were eligible. They asked if we wanted to come in to know more and check out some models so we decided to go in the next day. \n\nFast-forward to yesterday afternoon, we test drove a 2020 Kia Sportage SX Turbo. Going in, I was hoping that if we did decide to trade in our Sorento, it would be for a car cheap enough to keep our biweekly payments roughly the same. I didn\u2019t feel great about looking into a trade in so early on in our financing due to the negative equity from the car we barely paid for. \n\nThe dealership offered us only $17.5k for the Sorento. My question to them was: is rolling over that much money into a new loan really worth the crazy low interest rate? Their answer was yes, but I was still skeptical. They convinced me when they said that we\u2019d be paying down our principal much faster than with that 7.99% rate. More money goes to the car, less to the bank.\n\nI did not think we would be walking out of that dealership 3 hours later having signed a bill of sale and loan paperwork for that Sportage, but we sure did. \n\nMy regrets: \n\n1. I rushed the decision. I told myself I wouldn\u2019t but we were getting close to them closing for the day and I wouldn\u2019t have had time to come back for a little while. What if the deal was gone after a few days? I let them pressure me into making a choice right then and there, I should have slept on it.\n\n2. We are now binded to a loan of 49k over 84 months, $280 biweekly at 1.85% (apparently the bank could only offer 0.99% for loans less than 15k... 1.85% is still better than 7.99% though.... right?). That\u2019s an extra $93 a month out of our pockets and we have reset to 84 months of payments ahead of us. Negative equity rolled over was ~13k. \n\n3. I think we should have waited at least 2-3 years before considering this, to reduce the negative equity rolled over. But how much interest money were we throwing away with that 8% rate?? \n\nI need some perspective. Are we complete idiots or was there some sense in rolling over that much negative equity to slash our interest rate? Be as harsh as you need to be, I really need some guidance. We\u2019re feeling SO stupid right now but are we overreacting?\n\nFor your info, we haven\u2019t even driven this car off the lot yet, that\u2019s happening in 6 hours.\n\nEDIT: If anyone has advice on talking to the dealership about backing out, I could use that too. I know that legally I don\u2019t have a leg to stand on, but I\u2019m hoping to make something work.\n\nUPDATE (super detailed, for anyone interested): \nSo we spent roughly four hours at the dealership today. We went in there and first read through all the paperwork with the hopes of finding a significant error. The only thing that was weird was that in the loan paperwork, under our expenses, the amount I pay for my apartment rental was written as $1 (I had inquired about that before signing, she said that it doesn\u2019t really matter). The actual rent payment was put under my fianc\u00e9\u2019s name, who was put down as the co-buyer in this thing.\n\nThe sales manager came in and listened to what I had to say. He asked me what I want, and I said that we\u2019d like to cancel the contract if at all possible. He said that he\u2019s willing to go ask his boss. A few minutes later, he came back telling us that he didn\u2019t notice that the loan had \u00ab\u00a0already been processed by the bank\u00a0\u00bb and that there\u2019s nothing they can do on their end. We told him we\u2019ll give the bank a call then. By this point, we expected some serious bluffing. While on hold with the bank, we told him that we don\u2019t feel good about the slight increase of interest rate exposed to us right before signing. He replied by offering a $1400 USD rebate (not part of loan but I\u2019d have to make sure of that). He also added on free oil changes for life. We thanked him but expressed we\u2019d still like to cancel.\n\nWe were on hold for almost two hours but finally got to a CSR. We explained our situation, gave our names and phone numbers  and he attempted to pull up the loan information. He found absolutely nothing and told us that a loan like this wouldn\u2019t be processed in less than a day. We went back into the dealership to tell them that. The sales manager showed us an \u2018official document\u2019 from the bank itself showing details of the loan. That\u2019s when the GM came into the picture. He said that CSR\u2019s normally wouldn\u2019t have access to that kind of info so soon so that\u2019s why the guy missed it. He was pretty stern, telling us that they\u2019re within their rights to refuse any sort of unwinding of contract (which we acknowledged as well) but that he\u2019s willing to sympathize with us. He explained why it\u2019s not as simple as just ripping up the contract and going about our separate ways. Here\u2019s his points:\n\n1. \u00ab\u00a0The way that registering a sold car works, we can\u2019t register one and cancel that registration without the car\u2019s status permanently changed to Used. The low interest rate that we offered you, we got from paying the bank that difference in interest (from a typical rate like 5-6%) out of our own pockets. If the car comes back to us as Used, we can\u2019t offer that same low interest deal to others so we lose potential sales\u00a0\u00bb\n\n2. \u00ab\u00a0You were already in a not so great situation with your Sorento. At an 8% interest rate, you\u2019re spending over $10k in interest over 7 years. Why not put that same amount of money into paying down principal faster? \n\nSo as you can see, more sales tactics at play. My questions at that point: first the only issue is the bank already procesded the loan, now it\u2019s also that they can\u2019t unregister the car without penalties. Obviously they\u2019re trying to keep us locked in. I explained some more how I\u2019m feeling about this sale. Their general manager offered that we pay them $5k to offset their losses from: undoing the registration, from prepping the car for possession, etc. We\u2019d get the contract voided and get our old car back, which they now own. That was his final word.\n\nAlternative? Keep the contract, but with added incentives: $1.4k check (difference between 1.85% and 0.99% interest rate), free oil changes for life and a $1000 CAD credit for servicing from them. \n\nI know that these incentives don\u2019t measure up to our losses from going through with this loan so we don\u2019t wanna go that route. \n\nWe left the dealership telling them we need an extra day to think this through. We\u2019re still using the car we test drove as a loaner car for the time being. Still haven\u2019t driven the new car so hopefully it\u2019s not over yet.\n\nFINAL UPDATE: The contract is now VOID! We did end up paying for some servicing fees on the original car (cleaning, tire changes they had already done) but considering they cancelled the contract for us, that was more than fair!  We have 100% learned our lesson. Thank you all!","answer":"&gt; are we complete idiots\n\nI mean, that's neither here nor there.

At the end of 7 years, you'll have a 7-year-old Kia. Today, 7-year-old Kia Sportages go for about $7,000-$9,000 private sale. In other words, you'll have paid $70,000 for an asset worth 1\/10th that.\n\n$63,000 is enough to save a down payment for a $300,000 house.\n\nThis was a mistake."}

Let me know if I can improve on anything. Thanks!","answer":"For your age, and for the taxable account, you might considered some more targeted bets with high risk\/reward. If a few work out they can wipe out any losses in the ones that didn't.\n\nAt your age you can afford to ignore your bets for 10 years and see what happens. In the mean time if one of your bets really tanks you can harvest the loss and reduce your taxes.\n\nARK, XT, NOBL and FIW are examples of more targeted bets.\n\nI like XT because it's equal-weighted and gives you exposure to lots of \"4th industrial revolution\" companies for stuff like electric vehicles, IOT, 3d printing, AI, etc. They're betting the same amount of cash across a bunch of companies so it's not overly exposed to e.g. Tesla.\n\nNOBL are the \"dividend aristocrats\" so very established companies. I tend to think of our current economic situation as being similar to what happened before the trust-busting era in the late 1800s \/ early 1900s. Would you bet against Standard Oil in 1895? The main difference today is these \"trusts\" aren't monopolies but conglomerates that are more diversified horizontally.\n\nFIW is water rights and treatment, which we know fresh water is getting scarcer due to overuse by farming and manufacturing as well as climate-changed induced droughts. If there isn't a water shortage it probably means these companies are busy producing water, but if there is a shortage then it still works out in your favor.\n\nI'd say uranium mining might be a reasonable place to look. There's a uranium supply shortfall as well, and they've suffered as an industry over the years so are pretty cheap. However, Japan is turning some reactors back on and there are more being built in Asia and Eastern Europe. The USA still gets about 20% of our power from nuclear. URA is a decent ETF there to look at.\n\nFor your RothIRA, this is for retirement. Considering the economic situation, I'd say some mix of precious metals (SLV, GLD, IAU), TIPS bonds (treat like cash holdings, SCHP is an example), wide stock market exposure ETF (S&amp;P 500 or Russell 1000), and something with corporate bonds (e.g. GIGB) might be a good mix. I'd also suggest getting some foreign stocks in there.\n\nI don't think other government bonds besides TIPS are worth it right now, but others may disagree. The Federal Reserve seems like they'll be keeping yields on most bonds quite low with their various actions for the foreseeable future, and will be targeting higher inflation. TIPS bonds are how you keep your money pegged to inflation. You can sell them off to get cash to throw down on something else knowing that your money has the same purchasing power, that is, assuming there is inflation. I'm using TIPS as my \"cash reserve\" currently.\n\nOne thing to note that may be counter-intuitive: it's actually more in your interest to day-trade in a Roth IRA because of the tax sheltering aspect. For a taxable brokerage account I think it makes more sense to make a bet and hold for awhile."}

But most of all I have paid a stupid amount of money in taxes. In my opinion this is the biggest flaw in investing. If you win you pay. That being said I have decided to start my own church. This is the loop hole no one is talking about. Not only do you get free money from your members but you then you don\u2019t have to pay taxes when you make money with THEIR money! It\u2019s the perfect strategy. If you lose? It\u2019s their money! As far they are concerned it is already gone. If you win? You keep ALL the money. Literally can\u2019t go tits up.\n\nEdit: typos. Got too excited about my new venture.\n\nEdit 2: A lot of you are missing the point. We LIKE the Mormons. They have given us a perfect model for unlimited tendies.

{"question":"How long? First 50% vs Second 50% For those of you that have or are close to hitting your FI number, how long did the first 50% take vs. the second 50% ?  I've seen many people mention how much faster the 2nd 50% was.\n\nI finally hit 1\/3 my FI number.  It took me 11 years of saving 25% of my gross salary.  This was before I learned about FIRE so I didn't track saving as a percentage of net.  I just know that I was going to want to 1) take some time off to travel and 2) retire early. \n\nSix months ago I changed jobs, got a raise, and moved from a HCOL city to a LCOL am now saving 60% gross and 75% net. I'm hoping to hit 50% of my FI number by the end of next year.  That's 12 1\/2 years since I started.  \n\nLogically, I know that my savings rate increase and having a large investment balance will significantly affect when I hit FIRE but it feels like this is taking forever.  I could really stand to hear a few success stories, especially about how much faster the second half of your accumulation phase was.","answer":"I don\u2019t really know in my case.

{"question":"What should I do with an extra $300 a month? I will soon pay off a long term debt and have an extra $300 a month. I was thinking it would be wise to invest this somehow as I live pretty comfortably without it. But I\u2019m not sure where I should start. Should it go into a thrift savings plan, or stocks or something else? Or split it between multiple avenues? And if so, how? \n\nEssentially, what would you do as a financially savvy young person with an extra $300 a month? \n\nI have plenty in savings (20k in emergency fund total and another 20k split between other long term savings for travel, large purchases etc) but I know that with inflation these will be worth less and less every year, so am willing to dip into my savings to get a jump start on whichever investment strategy is wisest.\n\nI really appreciate any advice as I am completely new to the investing world and am a little lost on which strategy is best and where to start.","answer":"The general advice that you will get here is to put it in a tax-advantaged account (401k, HSA, IRA), and through that invest in a low fee index fund.\n\nI would only add to that advice by suggesting that you spend about $25 to $50 on a few books so that you can build the foundational understanding of how money investment works. For your purposes I think The Little Book of common Sense Investing by Jack Bogle, The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley, and Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin... You could also check out Dave Ramsey but it sounds like you are paying the debt stuff down.\n\nI think the advice you get here is pretty good, but there is nothing like developing your own understanding of why you would be following that advice.\n\nYou're on a good path. Keep it up!\n\nEdit: I'm way over estimating the $25- $50. You can get those books used in total for less than $15, I'm sure."}
{"question":"Accountant wants access to personal bank accounts, is this okay? Long story short, I was a sole proprietor in my business with no llc.

So it matters naught whether you have 100 shares SOI or 1 billion.  \n   \nAdditionally, those that talk about how the share-price can't move   \nbecause of SOI. Well no the size of the market cap determines how easily  \n a stock can move.  \n   \nThe VML Market Cap is 211M. So for 100% return it needs to be 422M. That  \n is the case irrespective of how many SOI there are. In an alternative   \ndimension there could be 100 times less share on issue. Guess what share  \n price at 211M would be $5.3 and if you wanted 100% return then it would  \n need to go to $10.6 = MC of 422M.  \n   \nFurthermore, comments around their being too much supply and too much   \nselling because of the share, if there was less this wouldn't happen.   \nWell ah do people realise that stocks with f\/all liquidity also have the  \n complete adverse affect on a share price going down. Ever tried selling  \n stock into a share with bugger all SOI. It craters! Unless everyone   \nwants to pretend that we only ever buy shares and no one ever wants to   \nsell.  \n   \nThe absolutely only time time the SOI matter, and I mean the only time.   \nIs when your share price gets down to .5c or lower. The reason it can be  \n an issue here is that you might be a 50m company. Means ever .1c adds   \n10m to the company MC and you're stuck with 10-16% swings on pips.  \n   \nThis makes it extremely difficult for people to buy\/sell fairly as it   \njust becomes queue position. Consolidations occur because of this, but   \nin principle consolidations don't impact you're ownership in the company  \n at all. The reason why people think consolidations suck is because 95   \ntimes out of 100 they are done with a CR which is the cause of dilution   \nand why they suck. But if they had no consolidation the CR has the same   \nimpact.  \n   \nIn short, SOI has 0 impact on VML as it's nowhere near 0.1c. If   \npeople are struggling to conceptualise why this isn't moving as fast as   \nthey hoped then you need to understand what the implication to the market cap are.  \n   \nIt's \\~ 211M today. To reach 10c which is \\~100% return is 422M. It means   \n200M of value needs to be added to the MC."}
{"question":"What is wrong with undergrad ECON classes? A little bit of background: I am an undergraduate economics student from Spain with quite a bit of passion in the subject. I am a Junior now.\n\nSo this year I came to a US University as an exchange student under a bilateral agreement between my Uni and Purdue University. So far so good, love the American experience in many ways, but in others, I have been pretty disappointed with the classes I am taking here.\n\nMy first two years of Econ in Spain were intense, but interesting and pretty integral. We started on the very basics on the first year, covering intro to Econ, univariate and multivariate calculus, intro to stats (Random Variables, probability, etc.), Micro and some other miscellaneous stuff such as legal frameworks for Economics.\n\nOn the second year we moved onto more advanced coverings of these topics. I took Game Theory, Advanced Microeconomic Theory, Advanced Macroeconomics, Dynamic Macro, Industrial organization and more.\n\nOverall, most if not all courses we had to take in sophomore year involved at least some form of applied calculus, which we obviously learned in our first year. No course relied on simple algebra or visual solving methods; many included some form of constrained optimization. We even went on to learn intertemporal optimization. We use all these tools widely. In econometrics, although and introductory course, we also learn how to prove and derive stuff and work it all out.\n\nAlthough my University is somewhat known around Spain for being pretty tough and reputable on Econ, it still makes sense that calculus is an essential tool of most microeconomic courses, and that overall, math is a recurring tool in many classes.\n\nBut now, I come into the US and it seems like all the ECON courses I am taking are a joke. None of them mention the slight use of calculus on their syllabus, and after two weeks of classes, it even seems like Professors are reluctant to that idea. They try to calm down their students saying things like \"don't worry, we won't be going into hard math like calculus in this course\". One class even had an introductory \"math review\" session in which **we were explained the properties of exponents and how to fucking plot linear equations.** It just baffles me and it feels frustrating that this year will be spent learning about applied economics without using math at all, not even simple supply and demand charts sometimes. Ever since I started college I have been told by many Professors and counselors that as an Econ student, the more math I take, the better. And I abide by it: not only do I love math but I love applying it. So taking Calc I and II in my first year isn't obviously enough, and that's why I feel great about having had to use math in so many other classes. But now, here, everything is explained in such a simple and straightforward way, with little to no reasoning, that I just feel like I am wasting my time.\n\nI'm taking Environmental Economics, Time Series Analysis, Behavioral Economics, International Trade and Linear Algebra + Diff Equations. The only two classes that seem math-wise are Time Series and Lin. Algebra+Diff Eqns, but still, why would the rest be taught at such a low level?\n\nThe way college works in Spain is that on the first two years most classes are mandatory for all students enrolled in a specific major. Then, on the third and fourth year each student can branch out onto their preferable electives, which must be selected from a pool of econ or econ related electives.\n\nIn my case, the ones that I was interested in most were developing Econometrics (micro and macroeconometrics, applied econometrics, proof based stats courses, time series...) and Micro (advanced behavioral econ, Information Economics, Advanced Industrial Econ, Environmental econ...), besides from others. So in order for my exchange agreement to work, I had to look for some of these courses in Purdue (or equivalent courses). This was already hard enough since it seems Purdue Undergrad Econometrics classes won't go further than Econometrics 101, unlike in Spain. But still, after finding some seemingly decent equivalencies, this is what I come across when actually attending the classes.\n\nI am aware that the Spanish university system is,  by itself, quite different from other countries', even European ones. I know the US college system is way more flexible and open in terms of what you want to focus on during your years in college,  that's great, but it seems this comes with the cost of -sometimes- lacking a strong base in essential knowledge in certain subjects. In all three classes I mentioned earlier, we had to be introduced to how supply and demand works, to what a model is, to how Econ is studied. How am I being taught this three years after I learned it, again? For anyone to be enrolled in upper level applied econ classes, I believe there should be a required and expected minimum level of knowledge and math skills. I am very frustrated and lost as to what to do and I am not sure anymore if coming to study to the US is worth it.\n\n**TL;DR: It seems that Econ classes in the US are a dumb joke compared to the classes I used to take in Spain. Almost no math at all and basic concepts from ECON 101 is what we've been taught so far (junior year taking upper level classes). I'm interested in quantitative economics and applied micro, am worried I'm not gonna learn much this year.**\n\n**EDIT:** Wow, thanks so much to everyone for their replies. Definitely didn't think this thread would get so many. All of your advice is greatly appreciated and I see things clearer now. I got a lot of new insights that will for sure help me out. Thanks so much, everyone!!","answer":"Yeah unfortunately it is like that at many US schools. They dumb it down for the undergrads\n\nMy school had an econ major and a more rigorous \"Math and Econ\" combined major which is more challenging and rigorous, as your Spanish University was. Maybe see if Purdue has more advanced classes you can take, including graduate level courses\n\nAnyway, props to your Spanish University for teaching kids right"}
